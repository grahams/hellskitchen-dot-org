<p><dd>     The other day I was thinking about the story in the Bible where Jesus prays not to be crucified; you know, the part where he says to God something like, "If it's your will, have this cup taken from me and passed unto another." I can't really hold it against him, either. Sure he was the son of God, but he really didn't want to die. Wouldn't it have been better if it had been like the "Elias Sandoval" episode from the original Star Trek series. All you Trekkies probably know the one I'm talking about: the one where Spock is hanging upside down from a tree laughing ("I'm not going back, Jim. I like it here on Omicrom Seti Three..." or whatever bloody planet it was). <BR>
 <dd>    Maybe Jesus should have tried that approach.<BR>
   <dd>  "I'm not going back, God. I'm in love. I like it here on Earth."<BR>
   <dd>  While Mary Magdalene, wearing a slinky Spandex outfit, is playing with flowers at the base of the tree saying, "Yes, it really is pleasant here, God."<BR>
 <dd>    But then I suppose God would have had to make Jesus mad, and after that time he snapped in the Temple and pummeled the money changers, no one wanted to push him too far.<BR>
<dd>     Anyway, here's a little poem that resulted from a game some the staff play. Enjoy.<BR>
