 <dd>  In Philosophy of Religion, the instructor instituted a sort of thought experiment. He initially asked what proof the class would need to be convinced of the existence of the Lock Ness Monster. In response, one of the students half mumbled, "A corpse washed up on the beach." The instructor then asked what would we need as evidence for the existence of God. Predictably, one of our writers muttered, "His corpse washed up on the beach."<BR>
 <dd>    Can't you see it? A bush, carbon  blackened by flame, washed up on the shores of the Red Sea, smelling of dead fish, yet somehow very divine(or at least worthy of sticking it in a nice color co-ordinated flower pot and hanging it in the corner of your "breakfast niche").

I mean, they might fall for a burning bush, but for a half-charred, water-logged shrubbery that would be considered to be in poor form for a weed? No. Defiantly not. I'd only entertain the thought for the sheer cerebration of it. <BR>

 <dd>    You know what Jesus said: "Turn the other cheek." And somehow throughout the centuries that message has been perverted to, "Kill no heathen unless he's breath'in." Ah...I don't know how, but here's my reaction to it and a little ditty I composed:<P>
