<I>Dear BFG,<br>
<dd>  In recent years, I've seen more and more people wearing their pants so the waists are rather low (somewhere around their knees). Why do they do that?<br>

Dear Sam,<br>
<dd>You're absolutely right, this is an intriguing phenomena and I hope I can shed a little light on the matter. Those people who wear their pants around there knees are actually incredibly unhappy. You see, they're in mourning, but instead of wearing a black band around their arms they've decided to wear their pants at half mast. I hope this has helped you to better understand.<br>
