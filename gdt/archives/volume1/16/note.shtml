<dd> Well, the academic year is winding down, and so is GDT. Hope you've enjoyed our stuff.<br>
<dd> We will be back next year, though. We hope to expand next year, and already have a number of ideas in the works including an internet site (thanks <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~one">Dave</A>), <A HREF="http://www.isc.rit.edu/~tbl2788/martyrlogue/pages/splash2.html">Saintly Travel Guide</A>, and a contest (even <A HREF="../../../misc/mailtogracies.html" target="_parent">getting back into Gracies</A>. You can help by deluging "Dear Gracies and Heidi" with eloquent messages about how you want us back). If we're going to expand, we need people....<br>
<center><font size=+1><B>Are you creative, bored, and look at the word through a carnival mirror?<br>
Than we've got a place for you.<br>
GDT is looking for writers(especially for more serious articles), illustrators,   <br>
cartoonists, or just concept people.<br>
If you are interested, or want more information, you can contact us.</B></font size>
