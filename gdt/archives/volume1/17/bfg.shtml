<I>Dear Bare Foot Girl,<br>
<dd>What do ants do when it rains? I tried to find out with my ant farm, but they just all drowned.<br>

Dear Hymen,<br>
<dd>Actually, ants in the wild have a much more complex social system than those in ant farms. Most wild ants actually regard the ants in ant-farms as imitations. Ant civilizations have the most advanced meteorlogical equipment in the world (second only to turkeys, which are, contrary to popular belief, highly intelligent, though  very depressed). As soon as the ants spot a rainstorm coming they all rush to their designated rain shelters (burried ten feet in the ground and reinforced with 5 gauge steel). They usually use this opportunity to get rid of those ants whom they deem undesirable (it's the ant version of Hitler's "Final Solution". It's also where  most ant-farm ants come from). I hope you found this illuminating.<br>
