<I><font size=-1>Have ya read this week's "<A HREF="../../../misc/reporter.html" target="_parent">Reporter?</A>" We sure did...and we'd like to take this time to respond to their editorial "Well, well, well." We would send in a letter, but it's the end of the year and there aren't going to be any more "Reporter"s this year.</font size></I><P>

<multicol cols=2 gutter=20>
<dd>We tried. We really did. Back when the year was still young, our then meager staff sat down and tried to turn an impractical concept for a radio show into a written format. We wrote our sample piece, illustrated it, and submitted it to <A HREF="../../../misc/kerstin.html" target="_parent">Kerstin Gunter</A>.<br>
<dd>We had hoped to be picked up as a weekly humor column.<br>
<dd>But no. We were rejected because we were inappropriate for the Reporter...even though we were told we were funny.<br>
<dd>You see...we were unsatisfied with the quality of the Reporter and did try to take an active part in changing things.<br>
<dd>After a few weeks of brooding, we decided to publish on our own. Without being forced to answer to anyone, we gladly lowered our guards and rewrote our first issue "<A HREF="../1/main.shtml">Ethopian Flypaper Boy</A>." Now, seventeen issues , two new staff members, multiple submissions, an electronic mailing, and a possible grant for next year later, we'd like to use Nathan Arnone's phrase:<br>
<dd>Suck eggs. <br>
<dd>We did vote. We cast a ballet<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#163;</A></a> in late January, but our vote didn't count. I guess that gives us a right to complain. Why didn't we submit when you were asking for submissions? Hurt me once...shame on you; hurt me twice...shame on me. Maybe next year....<br>
<dd>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre does not do news. We do humor, and creativity.<br>
<br>
<dd>And to everyone on the "Reporter" staff who has been enjoying our weekly printings: thank you. Sincerely.<br>
<br>
<dd>Good luck in printing the news.<br>
