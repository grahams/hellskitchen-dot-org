<dd> Ya know, we realized before break that we should share some definitions and phrases. Here's a list of words which we've either modified or just think are neat:<br>
<br>
<dd> <B>Anthropophagous</B> - Eating someone else (let your imagination roam). <br>
<dd> <B>Curmudgeon</B> - There's two meanings to this word. The first, as listed  by Webster's is "a bad-tempered, churlish man." It has been increasingly used in a more modern way, however: "anyone who hates hypocrisy and pretense and has the temerity to say so; anyone with the habit of pointing out unpleasant facts in an engaging and humorous manner." I guess you could classify Mark Twain and <A HREF="../../../misc/bio_Ellison.html" target="_parent">Harlan Ellison</A> as curmudgeons.<br>
<dd><B>Democratic cult</B> - second coming of Christ, passed by a two thirds majority.<br>
<dd> <B>Gwabug</B> - I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine, but my mom always used it. All she said was that they (whatever THEY are) "Gwa".<br>
<dd> <B>Intellectual myopia</B> - lacking the ability, or desire, to stop being an idiot. <br>
<dd> <B>Keep Your Eyes Peeled</B> - Eeeewwwww (I've never had the need to spell this before). What a wretched thought. Who came up with this one...and more important...WHY!?<br>
<dd> <B>Spoonerism</B> - A transposition of letters in a sentence. An example of this verbal phenomena is when, raising a glass to toast the Queen of England, Spooner (its namesake) said, "Let's glaze our asses in salute to our queer Dean." He got into no trouble, only because he said rather embarrassing things all the time. As a side note, one of our writers (yes, there's more than one crack pot. So "Luke, join us. It is your destiny.") has a number of English descendants who have the sir name "Spooner". The phenomena seems to be genetic.<br>
<dd> <B>Strapping Young Man</B> - What the hell does this MEAN! Does he liked to be strapped? Does he like to strap? What? What? What! Is he built like a backpack?! Tell me!!!<br>
<dd> <B>Verbal bulimia</B> - saying the same damn crap you puke up every day because you can't think of any thing original to say (example: "What's up?" When you ask that question, do you really care? People say it as a sign that they are willing to interact; it's a kind of door-charge. Isn't it easier to say "Hi"?).<br>
<dd> <B>Verbal dysentery</B> - The act of speaking when one has <I>nothing</I>  to say.<br>
