<H2>Comments From the Critics...</H2>
<multicol cols=2 gutter=20>
<dd>Because of the overwhelming response to <A HREF="../4/main.shtml">last week's article</A> on the barefoot girl (all of one response, which seeing as it is the only response we've gotten so far, it seems overwhelming to us) we would like to share the comments made and reply to them. In the future we hope to disturb, anger, and generally annoy many more of you.<br>
<dd>Due to space constraints, we were not able to reprint the entire letter. What follows are the pertinent parts.<P>


<TT><I><dd>Hello.. I'm writing this letter in regards to your "publication," "Gracies Dinnertime Theatre..."<br>
<dd>First off, you must be one hell of a insecure individual. Not only is this "publication" sexist in the highest degree, you speak as if you're perfect. As if you're ALLOWED to condemn people, and pronounce judgment upon them, based upon how they choose to express themselves.<br>
<dd>Let me ask you this - Has she (barefoot girl) ever accosted people preaching a message about world peace, or environmentalism?... <br>
<dd>You have *no right* WHATSOEVER to slander her, especially in a public write up. According to the first amendment, this type of bullshit is punishable by Law...<br>
<dd>You're just another typical <A HREF="http://www.rit.edu" target="_parent">RIT</A> asshole. Did you ever study your history? Ever read anything about World War II, and the Nazi's?... Is that what you're trying to start up here?...<br>
<dd>And don't tell me this publication is "just a joke," or "You're taking this way to seriously." Because THIS garbage is no joke.<br>
<dd>I could say more, but I'll save it. I think you get the picture.<br>

<dd>-Dave</I></TT>

<P>

<dd>Would it help to say that the guy who wrote the barefoot girl article believed in family values and loved his dog? Would it help if he realized the error of his ways and repented ("...repent, repent...")? None of it's true, hell he doesn't even have a dog, but would it help if he said that? Probably not.<br>
<dd>Dave already knows the punchline to this story. The fact is that I am the barefoot girl and an active writer and editor of GDT<font size=-1><A HREF="#ref">&#163;</A></font size><A NAME="back">.</A> Now, I didn't write that article (I did help, though), but I really don't see the difference between it being published where I can see it or being spoken of by strangers behind my back. The real point is that I just don't care what any of you say about me, and the things that are said are really very funny.<br>
<dd>Thanks Dave it was nice of you to stand up for me, but I don't like being protected. The one thing I would like to see is that the rest of you stop asking me that same idiotic question, because I'm bored of answering it and I've actually stopped answering it. So I guess that leaves it up to the rest of you to continue answering it, and who knows, maybe we'll write a sequel. <br>
<dd>So the rest of you can continue saying whatever it is you say. I don't understand the fascination that I draw, all I know is that you guys need hobbies. As long as you all leave my person alone I don't care what you do to my name; draw all the mustaches you want. <br>
<dd>I would like to make one final note: it's to that sorority girl who called me a "freak of nature" and then bravely ran and hid behind a couch.<br>
<dd>-My dear, if I may assume that the standard of nature that you use considers yourself as it's norm, or even the best nature has to offer, I hope you believe me when I tell you with the greatest sincerity that by those standards I believe nature's freak to be the highest and most prestigious position available. So thank you and give my regards to your pride if you can find it.<br>

<font size=-1><A HREF="#back">&#163;</A></font size> Since we told Dave, he has written us a second letter. Here are the highlights: "Ah.. Gee, I do feel very embarassed by how I must have sounded due to the letter of reply I just read...I guess now that I know she's part of the staff at GDT, it all seems different.. But.. I dunno. The first read seemed, well.. different...
 "P.S. If you need writers for GDT, I'd be glad to help."
