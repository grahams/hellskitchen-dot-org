<dd>I hope you've liked the new expanded version of GDT. All future episodes will be front and back, which means we can print more of what YOU have to say. <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> is not a newsmag. We exist only to amuse, confuse, perhaps even elucidate. Up to this point, we've printed mostly humorous articles (we think so at least, and that's what really counts). Page two of GDT will be dedicated to any poems, art work, cartoons, thoughts, letters, editorials, advertisements, etc. To submit an idea (maybe a regular column?), get in touch with us through <A HREF="mailto:gdt@iname.com">gdt@iname.com</A>. See you next week....
