<H3>From the Editors:</H3>
<dd>Your responses have absolutely overwhelmed us. We are sort of running around trying to set up ways to meet various requests coming in. In response to some feedback we received, we have set up a way for anyone to read current GDT episodes electronicly. 
<br>
<dd> We'd also like to introduce you to GDT's <A HREF="../welcome.html" target="_parent"><B>Religious Marathon Week</B></A>. Yes, a full week of GDT. Six special (Monday through Saturday) issues primarily dedicated to Christianity, in honor of the coming of Easter. Devout Christians please note: the coming  issues are not an attack on your beliefs; the religion is not entirely your fault. If we were better versed in the Talmud, Koran, Upanishad, the Book of Mormon, etc, we would be sharing the wealth. Give us time.<br>
<dd>There won't be many issues, so "<A HREF="../2/main.shtml">keep your eyes peeled</A>". <br>
<dd>See you all this week.<br>
