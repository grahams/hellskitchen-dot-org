Effective immediately, all Windows operating systems, including 95, NT, and CE, must be sold separately from the Notepad application, and Microsoft may not force or offer incentives to resellers to install Notepad with its operating systems.<br><dd>	Judge Don wrote in the majority opinion, "[Microsoft] isn't stopping anyone from developing new plain-text editing software, nor have they made it impossible to install a third-party editor of choice- but we also have to ask ourselves why there is no competition in the plain-text market. We believe it's directly due to Microsoft's inclusion of a 'free' text-editor with every version of Windows. This type of behavior must stop."<br> <dd>	Upon news of the victory, DJD attorney general Don commented, "This decision sets a precedent which may revolutionize the OS market. We have reason to believe not only MS, but other OS vendors may have strangleholds on the plain-text editing market, including Apple's SimpleText and VI editor in UNIX."<br>	<dd>The DJD office also noted that they are now looking into MS's inclusion of Paint, Telnet, and Calculator with its Windows operating systems. "I think we're on to something," noted one DJD officer.<br> </multicol></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><hr = 100%><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><multicol cols=2 gutter=8><font size = +2><B>Dream Newton</B></font size><p><font size = +3>I</font size> remember when the Newton first came out. Apple did a great job of capturing everyone's imagination. I remember thinking, "How exciting! The idea of handwriting recognition in a portable little computer!" I then recall thinking around 1994 that with the Mac's declining popularity, Apple ought to dump the Mac line and go all-Newton, ala the Apple II-Macintosh debacle of the late 80s. Apple put a mouse on every desktop with the Mac, why not do it again with a stylus? Learning from the Mac's history, Apple could license the technology to others to turn out all sorts of flavors of Newtons, from Pilot-size organizers to Desktops.<br> 	<IMG  width = 80 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images1/donland.gif"><br><dd>Unfortunately, the idea of the Newton replacing the Macintosh scared Apple management. Apple stifled its development, forcing it into vertical markets, and finally, nowhere. While Apple sat on its hands with the Newton, products like the Pilot and WinCE were developed to fill the void of Netwon's promise, sort of like the MacOS and Windows. History seems to repeat itself when you don't learn from it. Newton could have been Apple's savior, and shame on Apple for never realizing it.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
