A year older than me, Josh was both a friend and a partner in crime involved in the various activities I'd engage in. What has happened to him, I cannot say; as is often the case, college and the world changed both of us and I'm not sure we would know one another if we met today.<br><dd>The details of his graduation have been lost to me, but I remember something he said in his speech, and that he handed me a black balloon after the ceremony....<br><dd>He didn't speak of glorious futures waiting for the graduating class, or how they would rise to any occasion. He spoke of how all things come to an end... and how people live lives that destroy their souls.<br><dd>I know I will not do his speech justice--I heard it only once seven years ago--but it dealt with the responsibilities of students: the responsibility to question, to comment, to rebel. It was, he said, the student's responsibility to be the voice and conscience for adults who were trapped in lives they didn't want to create, let alone live. Students, because most are immune from the pressures of having to be wage slaves to keep a roof over their heads, are the culture's necessary revolutionaries and protesters. It is no coincidence that universities and colleges the world over are the source and focus of activism. We rebel when we can, because we can.<br><dd>It's our job.<br><dd>The speech really didn't come as a surprise to me. He was, after all, involved in a student executed protest that shut down the school lunch program of my high school when people brought in the material for making peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches and gave them away for free. In many ways the mindset and tactics which has allowed Gracies Dinnertime Theatre and Hell's Kitchen to survive were tested and proven back in high school.<br><dd>Ghandi and Thoreau helped too.<br><dd>At this point, you're saying to yourself, "He's off again. Damn, I hate when he goes on these tangents. What's his point?" Patience.<br><dd>I'm going to do my job.<br><dd>Propped up in front of me, just resting against the bottom of my monitor, is a 10 March, 1998 clipping from the local daily newspaper. In bold letters, it shouts: "Clinton strikes Iraqi oil deal" and says in smaller type: "The agreement was quietly reached to allow an increase in food-for-oil exports."<br><dd>Nice twist on the facts, but a lie nonetheless.<br> <dd>The general gist of the article is about a deal made between the United States, France, and Russia concerning the future of Iraq's oil reserves. The United States has agreed to let Iraq sell an additional 2.4 billion dollars worth of oil for food and medicine for the population, and to allow France and Russia (both vocal dissenters against the US attacking Iraq for non-compliance to UN  sanctions) to have first dibbs at exploiting Iraq's 112 billion barrels of oil reserves and on the multi-billion-dollar job of rebuilding the country's oil facilities.<br><dd>Maybe France and Russia--both countries familiar with having the bejesus bombed out of them by an enemy--just want to help out a kindred country. Then again, the potential amount of money that can be made exploiting Iraq's oil is...well, it's a lot of silly string. And who said Imperialism is dead?<br><dd>The best part is that by going along with France and Russia, both countries have agreed that if Iraq violates the most recent agreement made with United Nation's Secretary-General Kofi Annan, they will not oppose military strikes. The United States would have to consult the Security Council, but might act alone if unhappy with what the Council said.<br><dd>Over the past few weeks, a number of voices have been raised concerning the United States anointing itself the world's policeman, and in essence, I'm adding my voice to the chorus. Yes, I think Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man, but so is David Duke. Yes, I think Hussein is a threat to peace in the Middle East, but so is Benjamin Netenyahu. Regardless of who or what he was/is/might be, the United States is the United States, not the military branch of the United Nations.<br><dd>The time has come for the United Nations, if it dares, it put a muzzle on our military. We have the best equipped, most powerful array of armed forces in the world, but that does not give us the right to use force for the hell of it.<br><dD>I'll admit that bombing the Christ out of an Iraqi bunker would evoke nationalistic feelings in me (I'm male and like to see things that go boom) but at the same time, I feel my idealism screaming at me. We live in a society based on the rule of law and I doubt we can logically mount our soapboxes and preach democracy, individual choice, rule of law, and self determination while our military attacks a separate country, following its own path and with its own sovereign rights. Maybe it would be the right thing to do to attack Iraq, but it would be done for the wrong reasons by the wrong people.<br><dd>There is no ruling body today in the world which could legally stop the United States from attacking Iraq. The World Court is the closest thing we have, but it lacks the police to back up any hypothetical ruling it passes. Until such a time as a United Nations military force exists, separate and independent from any country, the United States--or any other major military power--can behave as judge, jury, and executioner. Attack with the blessing of the UN? Great. Attack without the blessing of the UN? Oh, it really doesn't matter.<br><dd>To the world in general: get over your jingoism. Fight the forces of balkanization as ethnic groups demand landlocked autonomy without any exports. Confront your worst fears and give a world legal body the ability to enforce decisions that might be to your disadvantage, not because you may be able to control it, but because it is the right thing to do.<br><dd>Remember back at the beginning I mentioned a black balloon that Josh Moody handed to me? Well, I kept it. I work forty hours a week, sometimes more, and the world is dimmer than I remember. Still I believe people can change what they see is wrong. I'm told I'm naive for that by people who sit in offices all day. "Look around you. Read the paper. The world sucks."<br> <dd>The balloon has, of course, lost all the air in it and is nothing but a pathetic looking piece of rubber, but I keep it to remind myself of what my job should be. I once believed that people could make the world anything they want it to be. I still do. Change what you know, and the universe changes. That's important. Good night, kids. Dream of revolutions.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
