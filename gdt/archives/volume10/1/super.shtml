Surrounded by the anonymous darkness, with the cold, uncaring light of ancient stars shining mercilessly down upon me, it is sometimes easy to imagine stepping through a long forgotten and unknown portal and disappearing. In supermarkets late at night the feeling can, ironically, become stronger. It's no coincidence that many people in our age have dreams of flying in supermarkets. There is something magikal about passing down isles filled with sustenance from across the world; a jar of spaghetti sauce from Italy; a beer from the Emerald Isle; blessed fish paste from the cradle of several major religions--most dead, but others thriving, waiting for their brethren's demise. The artificial lights and insistent Muzak don't detract from the feeling, but in the strange way that only plastic jewelry can add to the regalness of a seven year old girl, it includes another mystery all its own.<br><dd>For all of our advancement in knowledge and understanding of the world we perceive, we are snobby hunter-gatherers and some racial memory takes us back to the tales of the Sampo, bottomless cups, and cornucopia. Standing in the cash only aisle is the closest we may come to the fountainhead of myth. There, gods are born and dragons defeated.<br> <dd>Recently, on such a rare, mystical night, when my blood was more copper than iron, as I exited the doors to the super market without even so much as an "Open Sesame" to activate them and ambulated through the parking lot toward my mode of vehicular transport, I spotted a particularly sad oxidized member of the Taberna plaustrum family. With one wheel busted, mostly crippled, I looked on the old timer with understanding eyes.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images1/1.1.gif"><br> <dd>You'll never roll in a straight line again. You've lost your will to shop. Pretty soon they'll be hauling your ass off to the 15-item-or-less-basket factory. That's it. That's the end of your free-wheeling, care-free days. Gone are the last shreds of your dignity.<br> <dd>My heart ached.<br><dd>With one swift swat to the rump I rose to the occasion.<br> <dd>"Go on little fella! No one's watching! Roll. Roll like the wind! You're free now, don't you understand? Go on, get out of here!"<br> <dd>But the old cart just sat there, unmoved. It was too late for it now. It just sat there motionless with it's faulty child safety belt rocking gently in the breeze. What did it know of freedom? What did it know of the feel of weeds slapping at its axles, or the song of the wind through its frame as it raced down empty lots with a strong breeze at its back? It was never born a free-range cart. It had lost its will and dignity eons earlier. Between mishandling by disenchanted homemakers and rushed wage-slaves, its life had been one of regulation and neglect. It was only a matter of time until the basket factory. And then, who knew what became of such loathsome creatures?<br><dd>This was not always the way. There was a time when carts ran free, aluminum paint glistening in the sunshine, calculator pads fresh with untapped keys...unfettered wills all. There were days when not a child in the parish could ride such fiendishly clever beasts. Days when mighty herds roamed the massive plains of the new world and old, unburdened by human consumption or bags of cold ice cream. Days of glory.<br> <dd>The stories of cyborgs told in ancient Greece--half man, half machine creatures with the torso of a man and the body of a cart--were probably nothing more than the half remembered early encounters with the cart riders of the open Asian steppe. Further evidence for this can be seen in the fairly recent cave drawings by native Americans upon their encounter with astride Spanish Conquistadors. As though familiar with the ancient cyborgs of the old world, the Americans saw the invading Spaniards as great pale men with the bodies of carts and the breath of the great black panthers (there was a very good reason these beasts were solitary hunters).<br> <dd>Bringing with them God, Righteousness, and Civilization in the guise of the Inquisition, the Spanish inadvertently introduced the shopping cart into North and Central America. On their own in the harsh environment of the New World, ideas later to be popularized by Darwin began their steady assault on these metallic interlopers. As generations fell before the blade of Evolution these creatures adapted: larger wheels, more, lighter weight wire mesh, and that place for really heavy items became sturdy enough for a fifty pound bag of cat litter.<br><dd>	In time the natives, many of them forced from their ancestral home in the east by invaders, created the mythic Cart Cultures of the American Midwest. In less than two centuries, the Americans had become masters of creatures which had been unknown to them for thousands of years, making their survival on the Great Plains possible.<br> <dd>Just as their way of life, so dependent upon the cart, was created by the Europeans, so it was destroyed: Manifest Destiny swept the numerous Cart Cultures aside as the Europeans held sway over the land. As the natives found their lives suitable for little other than the sale of snake oil and the consumption of vast quantities of alcohol, their great wheeled friends suffered. Without the proper supplies to keep the cart healthy, many died of starvation and lack of rustoleum treatments. But still the shopping cart was a necessary resource. In the heady days of the Cart Express, where brave men and boys risked their lives to get the mail through the sometimes hostile lands of the plains, these metal creatures, filled to the bursting with news from families, businesses, Santa, and the government, could be seen for miles, their sides glinting in the bright sun as their riders, pushing along with one leg would place both onto the riding bar and shout with pure abandon.<br><dD>The Industrial Age--and later the Age of Invention--filled with all of its wonders and shiny things, was in fact the death knoll for the cart way of life. First the train, with its mighty rails disappearing into the distance, and later the cartless carriages driving hither and yon, gave the population greater freedom of movement. Today, with the nation crisscrossed with black arteries, clogged to the point of cardiac arrest with automobiles, we have become a culture of movers. Drive thirty miles to get to work ever day, visit a friend 800 miles away, and casually move 1000 miles from the place of your birth.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>In the dust of our progress, the cart has remained. Man never abandons something once discovered. No matter how advanced we become, there will always be men turning the soil to plant a seed, Gods, pottery, and carts...until their extinction. But even when the entity we call a cart has joined the mammoth, passenger pigeon, and dodo bird, the idea will remain. Today, these noble creatures, left with only the most menial labor in the new temples, carry our foodstuff without a nicker, without a whinny, without a complaint. We are their masters.<br> <dd>But neglect is showing. Bred only for numbers now, their gene pool is weakening them. The loopy wheels, Pentium calculators, and seat belts with two female clips are all evidence that this once great line may never be able to return to its former glory. Still, one occasionally finds the unexpected: a cart pure in line and form, rolling straight and true.<br><dd>Knowing that the poor cart before me could never make it on its own, I resolved to set it free in the absolute sense. Getting into my car, I slowly pulled up behind the forlorn, rickety cart and gently nudged it with my front bumper. Slightly startled by the jolt, it rolled forward, but quickly stopped, as though sensing what was coming next. With a tear in my eye, I whispered, "Hi ho Silver, away!"<br><dd>Starting slowly, the cart was hesitant. Five, ten, fifteen miles per hour, the cart tripped, unaccustomed to the speed that its ancestors once took for granted. Suddenly, something changed. The motion smoothed and the cart was happily rolling along at 20, 25, 30. Sparks flying from the bottom, both the cart and I knew it was time; we're nearing the end of the lot and a decision needed to be made.<br><dd>Flooring the accelerator, the cart rocked back onto its hind wheels for a moment, but quickly righted itself in anticipation. Fifty, fifty-five, sixty miles per hour, the rattle of the cart could be heard all over the lot and changed slowly to a soft purring hum. People exiting stores stopped and starred at the sight that they'd heard stories of in their youth, but never thought to see: an Arabian Cart at high speed.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images1/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>Just before the end of the lot I slammed on the brakes: the cart had to go this last bit alone. It shot away from my car, breaking the tentative umbilical, rocked up a slight incline, and exited the lot. Onto a major road, the lack of traffic in the night is best, for it was somehow able to make a gentle turn without slowing and began to accelerating away.<br> <dd>Suddenly, it wobbled and veered to the left, disappearing into the shrubbery and dense brush. At that instant, I noticed that several carts in the lot had slowly rolled near me, driven on by the wind. Gently they stopped at the curb, as though watching what had happened to their friend. In the distance, I could hear the shouts of the acne scarred cart wranglers coming to collect their way-ward wards. Without a word to the voice-cracking teens banging on my hood, I slowly drove away.<br><dd>	What happened to the cart that I helped escape, I'll never know. Maybe it was simply the last act of kindness to a dying creature to let it know its power prior to its self-destruction. I like to think that it is still in the woods and grassy areas next to highways where I sometimes see wild carts drinking from small ponds, or bathing in the mid-day heat.<br>   </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/mm.html">Mathew Mesner</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
