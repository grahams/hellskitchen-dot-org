Instead of using my brain, I subjected it to pop culture, faithfully observing my male instinct to change the channel every two or three picoseconds. I had to stop, however, when I came across the voice of the Dew generation, MTV. There, in all her spledor and glory, she stood. She was different, she had evolved again! That's why Madonna shall always dominate all that which is exotic - she does not fear change. Perhaps she is one of them.<br><dd>On this particular outing, there were no burning crosses, chiseled homosexual dancers, gondolas, or even NASA tailored undergarments. Just Madonna, standing in the middle of the desert, decked out in all black and strangely resembling a Bene Gesserit Sister from the movie "Dune" (All hail David Lynch). She sings something about being frozen and about opening your heart to love and some other words that are all mushy, but most important of all, she turns into a Rotweiler! No kidding! She wraps her large frock around her body, and suddenly she's a big mother of a dog, stampeding toward the camera! That's so cool. The dog runs and drools, and right as it's close enough to chew through the cameraman's neck, it turns back into Madonna again. Wow. Then she starts to sing again about love and communication and sentimental crap, but its ok because right after that, she turns into a flock of crows! First an attack dog, then crows! Wicked cool. Can this get any better? It sure can, but only with a little help from Tourist's crystal ball. Peering into it, we see what it would be like if I were to add a little something-something to Madonna's drinking water:<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images1/tourist.gif"><br><dd>The video is pretty much the same, except for that there are some other folks hanging out with Madonna in the desert. First off, Alice Krige from Stephen King's "Sleepwalkers". She can turn into a cat and make a Corvette look like a Mustang. Then there's that guy from the cartoon "Turbo Teen", who turned into a large automobile whenever it got too hot (remember that one, kids?). Add Robert Patrick reprising his roll as the T-1000 from "Terminator 2" (all hail Cameron), and the video is almost complete. Madonna is cultured, no doubt, so a little Kafka won't hurt. Add that guy from "The Metamorphosis" turning into a bug and the video is complete. If the material girl had that much star power dancing and transforming in the background of her video, there would be none higher. Except, of course, if Snoop Dog arrived in doggie-style form, along with Sigourney Weaver after she turned into the Terror-Dog from "Ghostbusters". Talk about a showdown...<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
