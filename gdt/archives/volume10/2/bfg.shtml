The pro-life movement is really just a subset of the taxidermy/embalmers lobby. It is not the act of abortion that disturbs them so much as the presentation of the remains. When they shoot doctors and receptionists (after a little bit of research into their background) they can get a pretty good idea of whether or not those particular individuals will be using an open casket upon death, prior to the experience of living vicariously through their bullet.<br><dd>What they protest to so vehemently is the fact that the bodies of aborted feti are discarded so readily into nearby trash cans and toilets without prior embalming or even basic cosmetology technique practiced on the wee corpses. This explains why the flyers they send around are always filled with the mutilated bodies of third trimester feti--they have so much more potential for ferocious posturing than first or second trimester feti.<br> <dd>In the case of abortion clinic bombers, they are the few specialized taxidermists and embalmers (but mostly taxidermists) who really enjoy a challenge. What better representation of your skills than a patchwork-human pieced together and smiling at their viewing public?<br><dd>As for whether these distinguished Americans run over cats and squirrels for fun, the answer is no. Running over cats and squirrels is strictly business; they have to have something to pose in their diorama of cat-riding, squirrel-hunting, pre-birth babies.<br>	<table width = 250><tr><td valign = top align = right>		-The Bare-foot Girl<br></td></tr></table><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><font size = +3><center>Questions for the Bare-foot Girl? <br> Send them to gdt@iname.com  </font size><br><center></td></tr></table></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
