My home state of Maine had only one black person, Abraham Mathus, and I really wasn't exposed to anything like Down With Whitey month or Kwanza (you know: the holiday no one in Africa celebrates created in the 1960's by bastardizing several individual ideas. But who am I to cast a critical eye? Christmas, Easter, Earthday, Dandelion Day, and RIT's own No Name festival are all nothing but pagan celebrations with the pagan element removed. (Europeans: "We oppress the pagan out to history&#153;")), so February was a time of enlightenment for me. I read about Benjamin Banneker, T.J. Marshal, Jean Baptiste Point DuSable and other even more obscure people in history. All in all, I'm impressed. Tell me where to sign.<br><dd>No. Really. I've decided that I want to be black--black like you! Black as midnight in a coal mine. Which, if you know me, is really quite a stretch. Being of mainly Irish descent, I'm so white that I give white people a bad name.<br><IMG width = 300 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/1.1.gif"><br><dd>I'm so baby white (Kids: Baby wipes! Seth:drools), and there's not much I can do about it. It's really too bad, too. What with the decreasing amounts of ozone, people with dark complexions are going to be better protected than us crackers. Shit, ain't no thing to imagine bunch o' beautiful Africans pumping that CFC shit right up into the sky to kill off all us white muthas. Huzzah, skin cancer.<br><dd>And with global warming causing the expansion of the equatorial zones, malarial mosquitoes will ravage the former white strongholds of the world in ways that the killer bees could only dream off. Thank God for sickle cell anemia. Sure if the gene is dominant your liver could clog at any moment causing insufferable pain and possible explosion,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a> but as long as you're just a carrier, you're set. The only safe place for the whites will be Liechtenstein. From their reclusive mountain refuge, the few whites will watch their once great empires fall and become a black world after all. They will watch their women gradually succumb to the temptation of huge black penises, and they will witness the degradation of the white BMW pool.<br><dd>Plus, if you're black, you get to buy your gold by the weight, and not by the so-called "discount price." You also get free food from the federal government, and we're not just talking cheese, here.  Not like cheese is of much use to the black man, since they're lactose intolerant, but cheese isn't a high price to pay for a bigger schlong.<br>  <dd>As proof that the inequity in our society still exists, whites can only buy Bud with their food stamps while blacks, being a stronger, more hardy race, are allowed to purchase 40 oz malt liquors. When not being used for cheese or malt liquor, food stamps are available for blacks to trade for crack cocaine.  Crack cocaine, of course, is a high quality mood maintainer<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#128;</A></a> that the black man has been forced to substitute for Prozac, which is a drug more firmly  controlled by whites  (housewives, to be precise).  As Geraldo Rivera has pointed out on numerous occasions, trading food stamps for crack is often a starvation technique used on misbehaving black children.  The children need to be disciplined in order to ensure their maintenance of the standards of blackocity; low-rider jeans, Adidas sports gear, cellular phones, pagers, gold jewelry, cornrows, hair extensions, and shoes that light up.  Black children may also be punished for failing to realize that slavery was originally the invention of the white man, and that "the artist formerly known as" is, in fact, still Prince.<br><dd>Until the time I can supersize my production of melanin, I can practice on the mindset necessary to be a minority locked in the socio-economic dungeons of this country, drinking 40 oz. malt liquor. Oh wait! <I>I'm</I> Irish-American and have it covered.  I even drink 40's of Guiness, a fine malted beverage. Last time I checked my history books and heard stories about when my Great-grandfather, a fuckin' Mick,  came over, the Irish were not particularly well liked, because they were drinking black beer. Killed by the Ku Klux Klan because of their religion, hated by foofy (i.e.- Protestant) white America for their pride, and despised by the working-class because Irish laborers would work for just about nothing.  My family has a long and sordid history of struggle.<br><IMG width = 300 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Coming from the dying land of Ireland where the potato blight and England helped clear the land of the unwanted populace,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a> the Irish that fled were simply happy to be able to work instead of die. Signs reading "Niggers and Irish need not apply" or "No Dogs or Irish allowed" might have been common, but the Irish succeeded in machine politics. Now look: we celebrate Samhain's corrupted cousin, get shitfaced because St. Patrick drove the snakes from Eire, and wear stupid pins saying "Kiss me, I'm Irish."<br><dd>Of course there are few pins proudly proclaiming "Kiss me, I'm a proud descendant of a Nubian princess," but if the Irish can do it, so can the Africans. Oh, I can feel it happening already! I'm feeling prideful and ethnocentric...oh, it's working! Free my people! Black is beautiful! (especially African-Asian woman. Yowzah!) I've got to keep it going....<br><dd>I know, I can talk about how my family on my Great Grandmother's side were slaughtered in World War II. No, she wasn't Jewish or Irish. Better: she was a Gypsy. Yup, palm reading, tea drinking, swarthy Gypsies were one of the lesser known groups that were a part of the Final Solution. (If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.) It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a><br><IMG  width = 300 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Where's the memorial for my kind? The Irish-Gypsy-American community should have a monument! And why aren't the achievements of Gypsies included in our school's textbooks? It's the Man, keeping us down, that's what it is, all you non-leaf tea drinkers.<br><dd>This is great...I now have feelings of persecution for a racial group which has had a minimal impact on the culture. I feel so repressed! Fight the power! I'm going down to the corner mart with my Kings of Africa Express card to buy a beeper on credit.<br><dd>Shit yo, if I was black (and I'm getting more black by da minute), I be bustin' out all the fly gear, kid, that would look bad on any you cracker beeotches.

He appears to be buying oatmeal, like the oppressed Irish of our land.  Ladies and gentlemen, please bring your Protestant confirmed children to isle five to see a black man, but do not let them touch him.  Limited time only."<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#131;</A> When Queen Victoria died, it was imperative that her subjects remained unaware of her previous childbirths.  A professional embalming job was impossible.  Instead, the royal circle enlisted the aid of a fly-by-night embalming service [they weren't union] who made a serious mistake.  While the Queen was lying in state, her body exploded. Positively ripping, whot?<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#128;</A> And when you don't have your crack, you're in a piss-ass mood.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#167;</A> Including James Joyce, who was also hated for his footnotes. <BR><A HREF="#5.5">&#164;</A>The ash that coated towns where camps were located gave them a year-round Christmas cheer.  Unfortunately, ash is what the fire has refused to consume, in this case the Jew.  A fair amount of the ash were also the Gypsies. In many academic circles it ha slong been believed that Oskar Schindler's car was in fact coated with Gypsy, and not Jew ash.  <BR><br> </td></tr></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/chip.html">Jonathan Goines</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ct.html">Clare Terni</A><br><dd>	<I>et. al.</I><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/jg.html">John Golden</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
