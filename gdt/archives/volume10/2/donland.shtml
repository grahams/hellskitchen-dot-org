Well, now that the magazines are ultra-thin, and combined into one, we find that coverage of a competing operating system, Windows NT, has started. While A+/<I>InCider</I> always carried news of the latest developments in the Macintosh world, its coverage was predominantly Apple II. However, as time passed, the magazine was running out of Apple II material, and began increasing its Mac coverage, until it was about 50/50 Apple II/Mac coverage.<br> <dd>While <I>Macworld</I> hasn't reached 50/50 Mac/NT coverage--nor do I think ever it will-- we see the Mac's biggest competitor infiltrating <I>Macworld's</I> pages. Tips for surviving in a Windows world? Making Windows look like a Mac?! Okay, these were already done in <I>MacAddict</I>, anyhow. But Intergraph's Pentium II-based ExtremeZ on the cover?!? Yes, things are dire when the best thing Mac Mags have to talk about is Windows.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
