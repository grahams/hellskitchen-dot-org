Our anniversary if you will permit. Well, I guess this is the last you will ever hear from either Sean or I.<br><dd>It would have been anyway. There is only one problem: since the beginning of the year we have been grooming various prodigies to take over in our absence. Only, one of them called it quits a few months ago, and the other said he didn't want to do it anymore last weekend (great timing Josh. Really, I mean that). So Sean and I are stuck on our "last issue" with no one to take over immediately.Well, no one with training, and with a quarters worth of subscriptions to fill, our sense of duty simply won't let us bail.<br><dd>We've got interested parties to take over for next year, but they don't know the ropes yet. This is just a little explanation for the next time you are rummaging about our Dramatis Personae thinking to yourself, "Hey, I thought he died." Not yet.<br><dd>On to other news. Some of you may have noticed that the issue came out late this late week (others of you may not have, this is in part due to the fact that I...uh...fucked up. Oh well), but you would be mistaken. Hell's Kitchen, and by extension <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> (a well known appendage) has changed its publishing date to Wednesday for our own convenience.<br>      Now Wednesday,<br> 	<center>	<font size = +1>WEDNESDAY,</font size><br></center><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top align = right> 			<B><font size = +2>WEDNESDAY!</font size></B><br></td></tr></table><dd>You can read the whole issue, but you'll only need the corner!<br>			<dd>	    -orner!				<dd>	 -orner!</multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
