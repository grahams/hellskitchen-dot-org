It still bordered on traditional punk, but I realized this wasn't just a punk band. It was pure rock, in the old style with just enough punch. The rest of the album follows on this path: great, solid rock with a good dose of roots punk (I loved "Streetlights" and its bassline that reminds me of the Cure's "Pictures of You").<br><dd>"Inundated Man Pt. 2" is a good, relieving break in the middle of this (quite heavy) album. But, by far, I was most impressed with the album's close. Track number 14 is a cover of Neil Diamond's "Cherry Cherry" with an added bonus -- Bosstones' Dicky Barrett makes a guest appearance!<br><dd>To top it off the album ends with "Saturn Rain." This is definitely the most interesting track. All thoughts that this is a punk band quickly abate as you experience an experimental, almost electronic song that ends with a short, sweet jam. In all, Clowns For Progress' PROGRESS is nothing new and breakthrough, but it is definitely refreshing and worth a listen.<br> <center>-Mike</center><p><B>Long Fin Killie: AMELIA  </B><p><dd>Scotland's Long Fin Killie, taking inspiration from many sources to create their own mixture, will release their third album, Amelia, on April 7th. The fact that Long Fin Killie utilizes so many sounds, styles, and past musical history makes it all the more interesting. The songs range from the styles of Morrissey gone jungle, Spiritualized, The Fall, My Bloody Valentine, and Slowdive. All of these styles and influences emerge creating a complex mass of sounds, and a new form to these styles. Their interpretations succeed in most cases, and they come out in the end with a complex, unexpected journey through British musical influences.<br><dd>"British Summertime" is shimmering pop, "Lipstick" has a Morrissey-jungle influence, "Kismet" with muted vocals, and "Resin" with strings all making an interesting, worthwhile experiment. In all, I felt the album is an interesting trip across many musical landscapes.<br><dd>Some of the songs, drawing on so many influences, turn out a little chaotic or messy, but the sound is very consistent nonetheless (even sometimes a bit repetitive).However, in all, the album is interesting and unique, and the pioneering efforts on Long Fin Killie's new album Amilia are well received.<br>  <center>-Justine</center><p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white>plugg&#233;d is a weekly music column focusing on the newest releases, providing accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information, coupled with informative and informed opinions.
