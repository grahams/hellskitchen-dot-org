NOTHING AT ALL, according to most critics, who wouldn't touch the film with a ten foot pole, saying it was excellent no matter how poor it really was.  "You can't say anything bad about Schindler's list!  It was so moving..."  Yeah yeah yeah, blah blah blah.  Well let me break it down for you, Sweethearts.  Here's an honest review.  The movie plot was simple:<br><dd>A guy saves some Jews.<br><dd>Awesome.  Super.  Good for him.  The world needs Jews.  I have no problem with that.  What I can't stand is the fact that if someone makes a movie about the Holocaust, it is automatically a "Grrreat" film.  Are topics these days so sacred that one overlooks the quality of a film to keep from being ostracized?  So ostracize me, it'll go along well with my excommunication.<br>  <dd>Steven Spielberg is getting trite.  Did you see "The Lost World"?  If you did, you know what I mean.  He's lost it.  I submit that he lost it years ago, around "Jurassic Park".  Don't get me wrong, that movie was bitchin, but only because Dennis Muren scored Spielberg some phatty CG dinosaurs that were hailed as the next step in modern filmmaking (uhhhh, did someone forget a little movie by some guy named Cameron  called "Terminator 2"?  I believe the technology was perfected in 1991 for use in its special effects...).  The acting was poor, the continuity was sloppy, and you wanted the dinosaurs to eat those little bastard kids (known as the "Shelly Duvall Effect" - as in when you root for Jack Nicholson to maim  her with an axe so she will finally shut up).   Anyway, since then, Spielberg has used various camera tricks to hide his suckyness from the average viewer.  What techniques did he employ in "Schindler's List" you may ask.<br><dd>By shooting the film in grainy black and white, he made the viewer think "Jee-hosaphats!  This film is in black and white when a man like Steven Spielberg can obviously afford to shoot it in color.  It must have some sort of esoteric and artistic significance that I'll never understand, but shall pretend to appreciate at dinner parties, to prevent people from finding out that I am really a Creton and hate black and white movies - unless they contain candid footage of the fitting room at Victoria's Secret."<br><dd>The second technique is the use of Ben Kingsley.  Now I know darn well that Ben Kingsley is a fine actor, we all do.  But not many realize that when watching his delivery on the screen, in the deepest part of your subconscious, a voice was saying "Wait a minute, that's Ben Kingsley.  He played Gandhi and won an Academy Award.  Everything he says, thinks, or does is of the utmost importance, for he is the anchor of any good docudrama.  It matters not WHAT he says, as long as he's saying something because he is Ben Kingsley, after all.  You are a dumb yak clamp."<br><table><tr><td valign = top><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/tourist1.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top align = center><font size = +2><B>Saved</B></font size><br></td></tr></table><dd>The last technique was what I lovingly refer to as "Spielberg Lighting". This is similar to bioluminescence in that just as some insects and deep sea creatures produce light without heat, in every Spielberg movie, you'll find light without lights.  What do I mean?  Well, in all of his films, there will come a time when you say to yourself "Where the hell is the light coming from?  The salt shakers?  That woman's crotch?   There are massive amounts of light, however I cannot discern where its coming from..."  So what?  Isn't that how movies are supposed to be?  No, goddammit!  Unless you're one of those experimental, artsy jerks who go around intensely smoking clove cigarettes and wondering what the impact will be on your audience when you double-project synchronized looping segments of "Unidentified Ass Number Fifty Three" onto a table sporting a fruit basket, lighting should be designed to go unnoticeable.  Not with Spielberg.  If he were to make a movie about blind midgets living in the deepest recesses of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, there's no doubt that he'd make light come out of somebody's asshole.  I have a sneaking suspicion that his obsession began after he made "E.T.", when he realized that he could get away with making light come out of a finger.  By screwing with the lighting, he draws attention away from the poor-ass nature of the film, and directs it towards an Oscar for best picture.<br><table><tr><td valign = top><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/tourist2.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top align = center><font size = +2> <B>Where's that finger been, Kyle?</B><br></font size></td></tr></table><dd> Look at the movie again sometime.  But really LOOK at it.  There's a lot of mistakes, and a whole bunch of tired cliches that were derived from MTV.  You think I'm kidding, don't you!   There's that old guy from the "Enter Sandman" and "Heart Shaped Box"  videos.  We've seen him before.  My pitty for him wore off when he was featured in the goddamn music video!  It's a paying job, EAT SOMETHING for chrissake!  Then there's that little red riding hood character, forcing the viewer to go "Oh my, the only part of the film that was colored was that little girl in red. That's so powerful.  I think that I should cry now..."  Ever seen a Nuprin add?  Or perhaps you can cast your memory back to the black-and-white-with-snippets-of-erratic-color video for Ah-Ha's "Take on Me"?  Spielberg totally bit off that, and the ironic thing is that the three minute video was far more entertaining and moving that the three hour epic that got so many accolades in 1993.  Halfway through the film, I expected a little astronaut to come out and saw a television in half with a chainsaw under the billowing MTV flag.  That would have at least given credit where it was due (and probably build a connection to the "unreachable" youth of today - MTV's Schindler's List, a top twenty countdown hosted by Martha Quinn or Kennedy and featuring Itzhak Stern, Rabbi Menasha Levartov, as well as Prince and the New Power Generation).<br><dd>The Holocaust was a dark time for humanity.  I was moved by the events recorded in the history books, in the faded pages of hidden diaries, and in the faces of those who lived to tell the tale.  It puts perspective in my life - no matter how bad I think it is, it could be far worse.  I was not moved by "Schindler's List", which was a two-bit ripoff of many other good films about that time period, that hid itself in a blur of Meleise-esque camera trickery.  If you really want to be moved, watch 1989's "War and Remembrance", or some of the retrospective on the History Channel.  Hopefully, you'll have some nice nightmares.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
