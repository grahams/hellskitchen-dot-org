Like language. What someone else says, just the words, should be taken lightly.<br><dD>What should be examined is the intent. Words are simply bunches of letters put together to make sounds and usually have meaning. The words and the meaning can be mutually exclusive.<br><dd>Why were the Jews in the desert for 40 years? Someone lost a quarter. What do you say to a Mexican in a three piece suit? Will the defendant please rise? How do you get a one-armed Pole out of a tree? Wave to him. What do you call one white guy amidst 200 black guys? Warden. What do you call the useless part around the vagina? The woman.<br><dd>Needless to say, these are jokes. I'm sure that some people are offended by the content. You should not be offended by the content. You should look at the person telling these jokes and determine whether the teller actually believes the stereotypes. After all, jokes are based strictly on stereotypes. Unless you have led a very insular life, you know that not everyone fits into the mold of stereotypes. In fact, most people do not fit the mold.<br><dd>As a general rule, people should reserve their judgment until they can accurately evaluate where the person telling the joke is coming from. For the most part, jokes are told simply to elicit a laugh, not to be analyzed for censorship. You shouldn't be afraid of the stereotypes; you should be afraid of psychotic neo-Nazis who actually buy into them.<br><dd>Jokes and vulgarity, in and of themselves, are not offensive. There are only people who get offended. There are only people who interpret the words to be offensive.<br><dd>For instance, let's say I'm telling a joke to two black people. I say: "What did God say when he created the first black person? Oops, burned this one." The two listeners may have vastly different responses.<br><dd>One may be appalled at my racist tendencies, while the other may simply laugh. The one who got offended probably believes that I look down on blacks and this joke is a manifestation of that. The other will take it for what it is-- a joke.<br><dd>What if the person who laughed was actually a friend of mine and the other person was a stranger? Would that lend more credence to my sensitivity? Probably, but it shouldn't.<br><dd>Some might say that those things should never be said at all, even in jest. I disagree. Just because you think certain language is offensive, that by no means makes it so. Jokes are for amusement. As I said before, they are based on stereotypes and they exploit our views of these generalizations. Only the most uptight, insecure individuals take jokes seriously. They obviously missed the point of telling a joke at all-- humor that does not take reality into consideration.<br><dD>Intent. That is what's significant. I have a very good friend named Ric who is of Dominican descent. Occasionally, I will call him a "spic" jokingly. He doesn't get offended or angry at me. That is because he knows I say it simply for the effect of a joke. He laughs; I laugh; we go on. I have other friends who call me a "kike" because of my Jewish heritage. I laugh it off as a joke, because they don't actually look down on me for that. At least that's what I think.<br><dD>It is harder to distinguish between who is telling a joke and who is actually a racist when you don't know the person that well. I think it's safer to assume the person is just joking, because nine times out of 10, they are. Who's the 10th person? You really should be able to figure that out on your own, almost immediately.<br><dd>Drawing conclusions about other people prematurely can be dangerous. So can getting offended too easily. Frankly, it's a turn-off to many people. It indicates an insecurity and lack of faith in others. For the most part, people are inherently good. You should trust other people. Don't let bunches of letters, words, phrases and meanings cloud your intuition.<br><dd>Curse words are just words. If you interpret them to be offensive, then you will be offended. The same is true with jokes-- racist, sexist or otherwise. They are meant to be taken as a vehicle for humor. So don't be that guy with the pole up his ass.<br><dd>But you should be on the lookout for the 10th man.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
