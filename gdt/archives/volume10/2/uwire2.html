However, if you've ever been walking around campus early in the morning and seen bananas and manifestoes hanging from trees and carrots sticking out of the ground, you may be familiar with some of their work.<br><dd>The PIFCMR's manifesto urges Brown to return to a pre-academic environment, in which students, faculty, staff and administrators alike would forage and hunt for all their food.<br><dd>The group's most recent attempt to increase awareness of its mission -- placing carrots, bananas and manifestoes on Main Green trees -- was censored by Brown Police and Security and Plant Operations workers, who deemed the group's use of public space inappropriate and promptly removed the offending objects. The group's outraged co-founder, a first-semester senior, contacted The Herald, hoping that the press would give his group some much-needed publicity and prevent such disrespect to its ideals in the future.<br><dd>And so, he was granted an interview, which he only agreed to under the condition that neither he nor any of his compatriots would be identified by name since doing so would be counterproductive to the group's "guerrilla tactics." In fact, all the members of the group have opted to remain anonymous.<br><dd>Before coming to Brown, the group's co-founder and spokesperson spent two years working on a farm in the desert. As he put it, "Coming from the city to the country, the lifestyle change really woke up my senses." After coming to Brown, though, he was dismayed by the unnaturalness of the typical Brown student's routine.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/uwire1.gif"><br><dd>"I saw the way people lived," he said. "They get phase-shifted; they stay up all night and sleep all day, during finals especially. They have an enormous amount of stimulants, like coffee, and it really makes you feel bad."<br><dd>And so, the co-founder got together a group of interested students and formed the PIFMCR, which now has about 50 members, although most are not as active as the co-founder.<br><dd>One of the group's first important tasks was writing its manifesto, which states its goals.<br>"We have moved too far from those natural and organic tendencies which form a healthy and livable society," the manifesto reads. "The time for Marxist Revolution is overdue and passed. We need radical change."<br><dd>"Only through the ancient and noble processes of hunting and gathering, farming and raising livestock may we find a livable existence. . . If you see a fruit, gather it. If you see an animal, hunt it."<br><dd>Although the co-founder's ideal society would be pre-academic and based on hunting and gathering, he realizes that this is not likely to happen. Instead, the group tries to inspire people to incorporate some of its more realistic ideas into their daily lives. "We see ourselves as basically a consciousness-raising organization," says the co-founder. He sees allowing people to pick fruits and vegetables from the Main Green as a way of letting the general public get involved.<br><dd>The group also has several other ideas that would allow people to get more in touch with nature. For instance, they believe in "an hour a day." According to the co-founder, "An hour a day basically means that you spend an hour a day outside, and that's not including the time you spend walking to your car, or from your car to class." He believes this to be an especially simple task, considering that, "It's so minimal, really."<br><IMG width = 100 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images2/uwire2.gif"><br><dd>There are other ways in which the group's co-founder tries to relieve himself of the burdens of urban academic life. He tries as much as possible to refrain from purchasing consumer goods. In addition, he tries to purchase only bulk, unprocessed foods and buys locally grown produce. For him, "It does extend into everything I do, truthfully."<br><dd>Although most people associate movements like this with vegetarianism, the hunter-gatherers actually encourage hunting animals.<br><dd>"It's not a hippie movement," says the co-founder. "It's not an environmentalist movement. There's something different about it."<br><Dd>The group does not plan to seek official University status anytime soon. "We don't see much benefit in being affirmed by the University," the co-founder said. "I'm not sure what it would do for us. We're more of a grassroots movement than a club."<br><dd>Although the group uses some of the same aggressive campaigning methods as the International Socialist Organization (ISO)s in trying to spread the word, the co-founder stressed that his group's goals were very different. On Marxism, his personal view is: "It seems like there was a strong movement towards that for a while, but it seems to be really weak right now, so to spend your time doing that right now seems futile.<br><dd>"What our group advocates is lifestyle change rather than revolution. You, in changing your lifestyle, and making sure that the services around you permit that, you can change the way things work."<br><dd>Although the co-founder does not know of any similar groups on other campuses, he feels that he and his fellow hunter-gatherers can fill a gaping hole specific to Brown.<br><dd>"One principle that is foundational to the group is community," he says. "There's a lot of talk at Brown, I think, about community. I think the formation of the group came about partially on the idea that [Brown] is not a community. In order to find the epitome of community, he suggests that one would have to look to the rain forests, where each person works toward the common good.<br><dd>Although many might dismiss the group as just a joke, in the grand tradition of the Association for Children's Suffrage and 21-and-over night at the Underground, the co-founder insists that he takes the idea very seriously.<br><dd>When asked how he would respond to the inevitable claims that the group's aims are ridiculous, the co-founder said, "I think that the situation, as it is, is ridiculous, and therefore a ridiculous response is called for. People do such ridiculous things as it is."<br><dd>He feels that the best way to alleviate such claims is by getting the word out, a goal that cannot be achieved if the University continues to remove the group's manifestoes from around campus. As the co-founder puts it, "I think the hilarity of it will be reduced if people understand it."<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size = +1><B>Illustrated by:</B><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/mjw.html">Mathew Weaver</A><br></font size><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
