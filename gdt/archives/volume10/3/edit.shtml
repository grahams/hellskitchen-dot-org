This is more of an editorial concerning recent trends in irresponsible journalism.  On whose part, you may ask?  Well, around here (RIT), when I want a good healthy dose of irresponsible, convoluted, misguided, biased and totally irrelevant tripe, I turn to <I>The Reporter</I>.  They always deliver.  And deliver they have over the past few weeks.  Nothing is cooler than black text on a black background, wishy-washy commentary, and their unique take on many issues.<br> <dd>Take the Rochester Cannabis Coalition (a fine group of people who balance  political action with a good amount of elements found in "Dazed and Confused") and the way the <I>Reporter </I>has handled their recent struggle with Fat Albert. In reading the various articles from the <I>Reporter</I>, one thing is clear.  There is a SERIOUS drug problem among the staff members of that publication.  Its obvious that they don't do enough drugs.  They probably don't do any drugs!  How do you expect to deliver objective and un-biased coverage of a major issue involving drugs if you don't do them yourself?<br>    <dd>Their last issue concerning drug use on campus was painful to the eye, due to the number of glaring errors.  LSD IS ACID, you morons!!!   Come on!  I'm sure that there are at least one or two people on the staff who have done SOME drugs (maybe not a socially acceptable amount, but enough to give <I>Reporter</I> a frame of reference).  If there weren't, they should have found someone who has done enough drugs to get the job done, and hired them for a bit.<br>  <dd>The article concerning Fat Albert's letter to the RCC might have been tolerable to read if it was presented by a twisted drug freak.  Perhaps the drug heroin would not have been spelled "heroine" in this week's issue ("In spell check we trust?" Is there an editor in the house??  Oh that's right, <I>Reporter</I> is in editor limbo. I am, however, glad to see that the head editor has stepped down, finally realizing that she's a meddling little trollop who's right-wing, born-again Christian, born-again-virgin, Gestapo views were not conducive to running  a responsible news publication).   What about the executive editor?  Doesn't he look over the proofs before they go to the press?  Guess not.  How does he expect to get a job in imaging science for the CIA when he can't find typos in a college newspaper? Jesus Dan, you were worried that the CIA might find out about your affiliation with us (for all you CIA background checkers, Dan Newland was a contributor for GDT Volume 4-7, and we suspect that he has numerous ties to the underground communist movement in America today) and not give you a position?   Well, looking at the mediocre job you're doing at <I>Reporter</I>, how could anything we say hurt your chances at all?<br>  <dd>Oh well. Takes all kinds, I guess.  It just saddens me to see all that tuition money going to waste on a slip-shod publication.  If Hell's Kitchen had one-tenth of <I>Reporter's</I> budget, things would be different.  You'd suddenly be eager to read the CHOICE campus publication.  Not because you want to find the errors and mistakes, but because there'd be worthwhile content, instead of cheesy photo essays (deadlines are important, boys and girls).  Who is going to care about the articles in a news publication if they present the reader with things they already know?  Good journalism transports the reader, making whatever the event or issue stated come alive on paper.  Simply listing the facts and making dumb commentary that is similar to the comments Bob Saget makes on "America's Funniest Home Videos" is not the way to keep readership.  You'd never see hundreds of Hells Kitchen's being tossed into the trash cans by enraged students after a "layout mistake", and "communication problems" caused severe amounts of anguish for members of the RIT community.   You'd never see us justifying what we print for the community to save face in the eyes of administration.  We are our own administration - we don't compromise.  We don't apologize.  We have something that <I>Reporter</I> once had, but over the years has lost - Journalistic Integrity.   Maybe one of these days, <I>Reporter</I> will come out of it's malaise and return to being what it once was - effective poignant, and credible, with attention to quality, instead of internal politics... he.. he.... hehehe... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!  I almost believed the sincerity of that last sentence myself.  DAMN, I'm good!<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A> <br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
