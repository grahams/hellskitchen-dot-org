I think everyone needs to take a step back and take another look at the issues involved.  First, we all have to recognize that Dr. Simone, as President of the Institute, does have the right to deny official recognition to student organizations.  That is a fact, and there is no evidence you can offer to refute that.  No matter that the Club Review Board (not entirely composed of students, by the way) is normally responsible for approving clubs for recognition, nor that the students pay an Activities Fee to help support Student Government clubs (this is by no means SG's only source of funds).<br><dd>Once we understand that Dr. Simone can do this, the question becomes <I>should</I> he do this?  Obviously, this is stickier.  As President, he has a responsibility to the entire RIT community to make RIT as successful an institute as possible.  For reasons that he made clear in his letter to Shea Gunther, he feels that recognizing the Cannabis Coalition would cause more problems than it solves.  His arguments (contrary to what marijuananews.com thinks) are not entirely without merit.<br>  <dd>(As an aside, the aforementioned site's article about the letter is at least as full of inaccuracies as Dr. Simone's letter - they clearly misunderstood, at least partially, most of his points.)<br><dd>Knowing the media of today, they certainly would make a big deal about the Cannabis Coalition becoming recognized as an official RIT club.  I can't say whether this would have a detrimental effect, but the possibility of negative publicity is certainly there, and President Simone is right to be wary of the possibility.<br><dd>However, I do agree that recognizing the club probably (note that word) will not cause drug dealers to show up on campus in significantly increased numbers.  That, I admit, does not make much sense, and President Simone did seem to be trying to find justification for his action in that.<br><dd>Okay, so that's my view on President Simone.  What about the club itself?  I believe the Coalition's insistence that they are not just a bunch of "pot-heads" trying to get their favorite pastime legalized.  However, I'm afraid I have to object to some of their methods.  The various flyers around campus have a distinct attitude about them.  The first ones I saw were very presumptuous, making broad claims about the government and other traditional views about marijuana without any support to back them up.  Although I recognize that the flyers were most likely meant just to get people thinking, the only thing it got me thinking was, "I'm not impressed."<br><dd>The other flyer I remember is one that complained about flyers getting torn down.  Not only did it target the Chess Club (implying, probably not intentionally, that Chess fans are rather straight arrows and would be in opposition to a Cannabis Coalition), but it also failed to recognize that EVERY CLUB GETS POSTERS TORN DOWN.  Again, a total failure to impress me, because neither of the clubs I'm in publicly complains about missing flyers.<br><dd>Okay, now on to marijuana.  I admit I'm not particularly well-versed in the specifics.  I do know that there is a difference between hemp and the traditional marijuana plant used for smoking, but I am not aware of the legal issues regarding these two cousins.  As I understand it, both are illegal.<br><dd>I have read that marijuana is not a chemically addictive substance.  This may be (I certainly don't know from experience), but I have also read that it is extremely addictive psychologically.  This is no less dangerous, in my opinion.<br><dd>Unofficially, I have heard that marijuana does not "kill brain cells."  Frankly, I've never heard anyone claim otherwise, so I have no reason not to believe this claim.  However, there is evidence that marijuana affects users' states of mind (Well, duh, why else would they smoke it?).  I feel that any such substance (the actual term would be drug) is potentially dangerous.  Yes, including alcohol and caffeine.  Does that mean they should be illegal?  Maybe.  Alcohol is a very ingrained part of American life, as is caffeine.  Ideally, that shouldn't matter, but it does.  Caffeine is different still, because, while it is addictive, its effects on the mind appears to be much less severe, and few incidents can be traced back to use of caffeine.<br><dd>I think alcohol is much more dangerous than marijuana, taken on even ground.  But they are not on even ground.  Alcohol is currently legal, and used by a vast majority of Americans.  Marijuana has a small user base (past users don't count), and is currently illegal.  Alcohol is a factor in far too many vehicle accidents, while marijuana is not.  This does not mean marijuana is less dangerous - fewer people use it, and those that do tend not to go out and put themselves in dangerous situations when they are "stoned," primarily because marijuana is illegal, but partially because it appears to reduce motivation.<br><dd>So, I don't know where I stand on the legalization issue.  I don't think marijuana should be legalized just because it has potential benefits.  I also don't think these potential benefits should be ignored.  The problem is allowing it to be used for medicinal and other purposes, without encouraging its abuse.  That's where the real danger lies - in the potential for abuse.  True, any object or substance has that potential, but marijuana has a higher potential than many of those things.<br><dd>So to sum up.  President Simone was well within his rights to protect the image of the Institute by refusing to recognize the Cannabis Coalition.  However, he may have overestimated the club's potential effect on the image of the Institute.<br><dd>The Cannabis Coalition's goals are admirable, but I feel they need to be less confrontational and more accessible.<br><dd>The benefits and uses of marijuana (not the user base - "70 million Americans have tried it" is not a valid reason to legalize it) are well documented and have much merit, but there are many unresolved issues regarding its negative effects.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
