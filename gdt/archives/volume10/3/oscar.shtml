An industry is giving itself a pat on the back for a job well done.  Caviar, Champaign, beautiful people, millions of fans - it's a tough job and they deserve to relax, get drunk and bloated and take tomorrow off, lest they immortalize their hangovers on celluloid.<br> <dd>And what an Oscar spectacular it was.  I knew it was going to be a night of surprises when I heard Scream I and II's Neve Campbell introduce the performance of best song nominee: Hercules "Go the Distance." In a blank, deadpan voice, she read from the TelePrompTer, "...which will be performed by the exciting Michael Bolton."<br> <dd>Wow, that was a phrase I never expected to hear in this, or any other lifetime! (If I had to give an acceptance speech after the performance of Michael Bolton, I would make sure to thank Percy Sledge, the writer of "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay," who was the only person in the world Bolton didn't thank when accepting his Grammy for ripping off that song.) Even though I am "not in the business," the Oscars were not completely lost on me.<br> <dd>For instance, there was Ashley Judd's dress, or, to be more specific, the slit along the leg in Ashley Judd's dress.  As this actress from "Kiss the Girls" walked across the stage to present the award for... I forget what now... she flashed hundreds of millions of home viewers her black velvety kitten with each alternate step. (It could've been black panties, but fashion conscience actresses know it's uncouth to show panty lines under a tight dress, and I didn't see any lines.)<br> <dd>And for the first time I got to see what Anne Dudley looks like when she received the award for the music of The Full Monty.  "Who's Anne Dudley," you ask?  Ever hear of a little band in the eighties called Art of Noise?  She has been a member of that particular band which innovated noise sampling for musical intentions since its inception.  I have all their albums and been a fan of them for ten years, but images of the band are scarce, if not completely non-existent.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> I imagined her being as avant-garde in her appearance as she was with her music.  "What does Anne Dudley look like, anyway," you might ask?  She looks like an average English housewife in her late forties.<br>  <dd>The night also was a big one for Philip Glass, who didn't win, but was at least nominated for his downright quirky use of arpeggios in the barely viewed visual epic masterpiece, Kundun.<br> <dd>The biggest Oscar night story, however, has to be about someone who decided not to go...Leonardo DiCaprio.<br> <dd>Ignored by the Academy in that he failed to be nominated, he publicly announced his plans for non-attendance and went on to declare a year sabbatical with the less than subtle tone of, "We'll just see if Hollywood can manage to make another blockbuster without me."<br> <dd>Sorry to burst your bubble, boy-boy, but Titanic was going to be big, with or without you. That is, after all, the definition of the word "titanic" - big. Leonardo wasn't a lead actor in this movie;  he was just a walking, talking YM pinup with the most lines in the biggest movie of all time. Jonathan Taylor Thomas of Home Improvement could have been as convincing.<br> <dD>Just because Leo's agent managed to get him points (I believe it was 2.5% of the profits) doesn't mean he's worth $20 million dollars a film. Was he worth that much when he was in The Quick and the Dead?  What about Critters 3?  Oh, and let's not forget the soon to be forgotten Man in the Iron Mask, which will be on airplanes and network TV before Das Boat sinks from its number one box office position.<br><center><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/johnkate.gif"><br></center> <dd>Who's nomination spot does he think he deserves?  Dustin Hoffman's? Peter Fonda's?  Robert Duvall's? Freakin' Jack Nicholson's?  I don't think so. Two words: Matt Damon.  This nobody! Out of nowhere! He comes along with his similarly boyish good looks and steals Leo's thunder.  What does Matt have that Leo doesn't?  Let's see... could it be... talent? (And lots of it.  Who above the age of 17 would disagree that Matt Damon would have been better in Titanic's lead role?)<br> <dd>I'd respect him if he said: "No, I'm not going because I value every second of my fleeting youth, the ceremony's too long (it did run 42 minutes over). And in the time it takes Jack Nicholson to get from his front row seat to the podium I can meet and bo four barely legal fashion models."<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a><br> <dd>He didn't give that reason, leaving all of the Hollywood community thinking he wasn't man enough to accept that he still needs to learn an important lesson... how to act; both on and off the stage.<br> <dD>I wholeheartedly support this impudent nothing-but-a-pretty-boy's year off.  If you see him, offer him some crack or heroin.  Even if you don't use any, find out how to get some and offer them to him.  He might not take them, but who knows?  A year can do a lot to destroy your career.   River Phoenix took a year off.  Chris Farley was about to take a year off and didn't make it past the first weekend!  This would bring me great joy, but I would be happy if his vacation is only enough to make him the next Todd Bridges<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a> or Robert Downey, Jr.<br> <dd>I took a year off.  Nobody noticed except my closest friends, and my next door neighbor, who's trying to figure out what I'm doing in the basement, two o'clock in the morning, in my underwear.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> One member of Art Of Noise, Trevor Horn, went on to sing "Video Killed the Radio Star."
