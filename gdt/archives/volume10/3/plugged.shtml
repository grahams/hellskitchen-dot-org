Yes, it is indeed.<br> <dd>The band consists of Lansana (vocals, guitar, djembe and other African percussion), Greg Newton (sax), David Tickell (bass), Dylan Savage (guitar), Ian Nelson (drums), Mike Toner (keys), and Steve Imburgia (congas, djembe, and other percussion).<br> <dd>Djoliba is a local, Rochester area band that has performed in numerous locations all over Rochester, including Water Street Music Hall, Milestones, etc.<br> <dd>Their sound comes primarily from very African influences, as Lansana hails from Guinea (not New Guinea) in West Africa, and can be found donning interesting traditional garb at performances. Adding to the African feel, none of the lyrics are in English and range from being festive to very political.<br><dd>Their music is extremely jam-heavy and energized, with plenty of exciting percussion and rhythm. Greg's soulful sax playing and near-goofy stage presence seem to be a Djoliba trademark but the band makes no secret that Lansana is the band's leader, as he is the main vocalist and the center of attention.<br> <dd>Together, the band integrates all the instruments well and cohesively, which is no small feat for such an outfit. Their collective sound is unique, exciting, and refreshing, yet not entirely new. So rarely does a quality group like Djoliba surface that combines African lyrics and a jam-band sound with Rusted Root-like percussion, especially in this area, their novelty more than makes up for it.<br> <dd>They have released a homemade tape, simply entitled "HOT." The tape does not contain their newest material and the production does not effectively capture the energy and edge of the live performances, but it is good for a local production and will be a worthy member of any collection.<br> <dd>In short, Djoliba is an exciting local band with a distinctive African flavor that our area is very lucky to have. If you get a chance to see one of their shows, go and see for yourself what all the excitement is about. "This is African music!"<br> <center>-Mike</center><p><B>Fretblanket: Home Truths From Abroad  </B><p><dd>"Home Truths From Abroad" is Fretblanket's second effort after a three-year absence following "Junkfuel." Fretblanket are British, but will most likely find more popularity in the US (a la Bush). Their sound has more American influences, such as the Pixies, but they have learned a bit from Radiohead as well.<br> <dd>"Into The Ocean" is Fretblanket's single, which is a very catchy pop-rock song that makes one want to either play it really loud, jump up and down, or clap and sing along (it has a very straightforward chorus). It's a great song.<br> <dd>Fretblanket's second album has more variety than their first. Unfortunately, the only stand-out track is, at first listen, "Into The Ocean." Eventually, with repeated listenings, more tracks start to differentiate, such as "Killer In A Former Life", "Why Can't I Sleep?", "Me And The Stars", "Accident En Route," "Abandon Ship," and "Black Tambourine."<br> <dd>Overall, this is a solid effort from Fretblanket. Hopefully, the world won't have to wait so long for their next. These are songs which should be played loud, and in your room. Perhaps their next effort will expand to further territory.<br>  <center>-Justine</center><p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white>plugg&#233;d is a weekly music column focusing on the newest releases, providing accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information, coupled with informative and informed opinions.
