If you napalm that thing, you'll solve the drug problem at RIT."<br> <dd>This was reportedly one observer's opinion on the quarter mile on Friday, March 27th, as members and supporters of the Rochester Cannabis Coalition, and the curious marched toward RIT's academic buildings. Carrying signs with messages such as "This is our school" and "Who will they censor next?", these students were protesting RIT President Al Simone's decision to deny student organization status to the RCC. The rally began in the Sol Heuman quad around 1:30pm, where RCC Treasurer Kris Lotlikar addressed a small gathering of supporters and observers.  According to Mr. Lotlikar, the RCC had been approved by the student activities board to form an official student organization on campus several weeks ago, but the board's decision had been overturned by President Simone due to the organization's subject matter-specifically,  the legalization of marijuana.<br><center><table border = 2 noshade><tr><td valign = top align = right> <center><I>I went down to the demonstration<br> To get my fair share of abuse. . .</I><br></center> 		- The Rolling Stones<br></td></tr></table></center><br><dd>We followed the RCC and its supporters in their march, attended one of their meetings, and interviewed a group of representatives. The RIT administration claims that allowing the RCC to form an official club would encourage drug use and related crimes on campus.  The RCC contends that approximately 25 other universities,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#248;</A></a> many highly accredited, have similar student organizations without such problems. When the RCC learned of President Simone's decision, members collected over 1000 signatures for a petition to oppose this action. This rally was evidence of growing support for the RCC on campus, and a new high water mark in the continuing student opposition of Simone's policies. From the Save Our Schools campaign of 1995-96 school year, to RIT's new alcohol policy, to this latest confrontation with the RCC, there has been no shortage of criticism from the student population.<br> <dd>The group of approximately 200 stopped near the end of Lomb Memorial Drive, blocking the "wind tunnel" between the Eastman Building and the Student Alumni Union.  Shea Gunther, president of the RCC, stood atop a trash can and addressed the crowd using a hastily constructed PA system. Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd regarding Simone's policies and the need for RIT students to unite behind the cause of reform, he also encouraged attendance at the RCC meeting later that afternoon.<br> <dd>To learn more about the RCC's goals, and to meet some of its members, we attended the RCC meeting in the Booth building the afternoon of the rally. At the start of the meeting, RCC President Shea Gunther discussed the nature of the RCC and its goals and other members read reports of news involving marijuana issues, and attempted to gauge reactions to the rally. There seemed to be a consensus that the rally had been very well received.  We learned that RCC membership includes - for a $10 fee - several benefits, such as access to the RCC library, membership in NORML (the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a>), and the RCC's legal advice.  Shea Gunther predicted that the college cannabis movement will be the largest and most powerful college movement within five years. Approximately 20 people attended the meeting.<br><dd>Following the meeting, we conducted an interview with three officers of the RCC.<p><center><IMG  width = 150 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/leaf.gif"><br></center> <dd><i><B>GDT:</B> What are your names and positions within the RCC?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Shea Gunther, President<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B>Kris Lotlikar, Treasurer<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Terrell):</B> Davis Terrell, Webmaster<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> What is the official procedure for forming a student organization at RIT? What was your experience, specifically?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther):</B>  We had to fill out a 4 page application, stating the purpose of the club, provide with a membership list, and we passed that in to the head of University Organizations. The board meets about every two weeks to review new club applications.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Who is on the board?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>  It's all students; I'm not sure exactly how you get on the board.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>What is the name of the board?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Not sure, Club review? They sat down, and I talked to one of the people who was on the board, and the point was brought up how women couldn't vote, however long ago, but they still had the right to say what they felt. They came up with a decision that they couldn't deny us just because they didn't like what we had to say. They made the right decision.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> How did you get the RCC started?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I hung up posters, kids started coming. I started holding weekly meetings. Attendance fluctuated, but we got some good people.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> When was the decision made to accept you?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B>It was 6 weeks ago last Monday [February 9th, 1998]<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> When did President Simone get involved with the decision?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> As soon as we got approved, Al Simone pulled us up for administrative review, and it took five weeks for them to get back to us.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Who handles administrative reviews?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I think it went to Dr. Linda Kuk and she passed it on to Simone. Dr. Simone decided to reject it. We talked to the Ombudsman, Dr. Laura Tubbs.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> When did the word come through from Simone?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Me and Kris met with him last Monday. He talked with Kris and I and he gave us a letter which outlined his thoughts and also told us that he disbanded the club.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a><br><dd><I><B>GDT:</B> So Al just said no?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther):  </B>His reasoning is that it would make RIT appear to condone drug use and that he is afraid that criminals from Rochester will come to RIT to sell their drugs because [the criminals] heard that we have such a club.  If you look at the other clubs like ours that have been around, none of that proves true.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> What reactions have you gotten from students, both to what went on before, and to the rally itself ?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I think the student reaction has been pretty good.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B> We have a lot of apathy at RIT, a lot of people don't care either way. They just say well, whatever, but there are kids that do care. A lot of people think that we just want the school's money so that we can buy pot. But we are not about drug use; we are about education. That's what this is supposed to be about.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> One day, we went to the SAU and filled about 4 pages of signatures for the petition, and had maybe five kids tell me that they wouldn't sign it.  A lot of people who signed it said that they may not agree with our cause, but they think that Al made the wrong decision.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>So the rally went well?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Oh yeah, the rally went way better than I was expecting.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> A lot of people joined the march and stood on the side voicing their support. We made rough estimates of 160 or more when the group left frat row, and by the time the march was at the SLC [RIT's Student Life Center] there could have been as many as 200, perhaps more.</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B> We had someone counting about 300 by the SAU. Yes, the rally went very well.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> You seemed to do well; you seemed to get many people signing the petition, and I didn't see many people opposing the rally. Do you feel that there is a strong opposition, barring the administration (Al Simone specifically)?</I><br> <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Um, there are always going to be kids that have been so brainwashed. . .<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B>  Yeah, straight-edge.  Kids who are straight-edge think that 'cause they don't smoke pot. . . .  It's like people who don't have AIDS bashing down on an AIDS rally.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Have you heard any other reactions from the administration, apart from Simone?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I've had indications that a lot of the administrators think that Simone should have just accepted us. If we were approved two weeks ago, we might just have made the five- or six-o'clock news and then everyone would have forgotten about us.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B> If he had just approved us, there would have been no reason for the news to get involved.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Well, they would have reported us, but then they would have forgotten.  It's bad public relations-he says he doesn't want bad press, but he called a news conference the morning after he denied us, a 10:30 press conference.  I found out about it at 10 o'clock and managed to talk to some reporters, on the side of the road, across from his house (because they kicked me off the grounds). At the president's house-the house that we built.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Any reactions from the administration about the rally?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B>Dr. Linda Kuk complimented us, and said that it was a good rally.<br><dd><B>RCC  (Loklikar): </B> There is no way [Simone] is going to talk to a mass number of students because he's not a very good public speaker, especially on the fly if he hasn't written what he is going to say.  He might meet with a few of us one on one, but he will never meet with a lot.  It really would just be such a bad idea for him to come out and meet with us. You don't go with a hostile audience toward you and try to discuss something. No matter what he said.<br> <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B> He can't really justify his decision because his reasons don't hold up to reality.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> How do you think this compares to the "Save Our Schools" rally of three years ago?  I think it's along a similar vein in removing the rights of the students without first consulting them, but where that was a scholastic issue, this is basically just a student activities issue (which might not get as much attention).</I><br> <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I don't know a whole lot about what went on, but that if you look at that, what he's done with the alcohol policy, and what he's done with us, I think it just indicates that-I don't think President Simone has been a very good thing for the RIT campus.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>Do you think that the timing of your decision to become a club and the strengthening of the RIT drug and alcohol policy was poor? Do you think it affected his decision?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I think it did.  Just because he's under this pressure to look tough on drugs and to look tough on alcohol. But the problem is his policies aren't designed, his alcohol policy isn't designed to limit the harm of alcohol, it's designed to look strong, and the same thing with us. His policy is not designed in the best interests of the students, it's designed to look tough.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Simone once said that 18-22 year olds have no voice and if they want to vote, they can vote with their feet.</i><A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a><i>What is your reaction to this?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Lotlikar):</B>  If you don't think that people 18-21, or whatever his ages were, aren't competent enough to make decisions, then you shouldn't be president of a college, because those are the kind of people. . .<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>   That is the wrong kind of attitude to have.  It just shows his complete lack of respect for us. It's our school: he should be leading us; he should not be making statements like that, and his attitude is 100% that. He doesn't think that students can make competent decisions.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> I think your timing was excellent regarding holding the rally on an open house day.</I><br><dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B> Yeah, that was unintentional, but it worked out really well.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Did you notice any of the parents' reactions?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther):</B>  I didn't personally,  but I've been told that a lot of parents-<br>  <dd><B>Dave  Bort  [observer]:</B>  When we were in Sol Heuman quad,  a lot of parents were asking people what this was all about. I told one guy what it was all about and he basically said "What is this, a police state?"<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> I noticed both, walking with you guys, I saw reactions of both disgust and support from parents.</I><br> <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B> When you are dealing with marijuana, you are always going to get that, because some people are just so fervent and adamant and they don't really know the issues. You're going to get people like that everywhere.<br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Lotlikar):</B>  When they look at legalization, they look at it as an excuse for us to smoke more pot.  And we are not saying legalize so we can smoke more pot-I can smoke as much pot as I want now. That's not the issue. The issue is that the laws are hurting our country-<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> -the policies are bad.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> I think it would do a lot more to cut down on marijuana abuse, get it to an acceptable level, where we could handle it, when it's legalized. It's easier for high school kids to get a 10 bag than a beer.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>  The Dutch have effectively legalized it, and allowed it to be sold in cafes, and they have just about the same percentage rate of adult use [as the US], but they have a much much lower rate of use among children.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> 18% as compared to 60%.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> The same thing holds true for [the Dutch's] more liberal alcohol policy. Do you feel that there is a significant population of marijuana users among RIT students?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I'm not too sure. I do know that kids, I mean, anywhere you go,  people are going to be smoking.  Marijuana is the most-used illicit recreational drug. As far as numbers or comparisons, I'm not too sure.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B>But there is a good amount of kids that smoke. Even still, in the dorms, with alcohol compared to marijuana, if they catch you holding a beer, they warn you.  Sometimes if the campus safety officer is a dick, they throw them in, but if they smell something, they want to go through your room, they want to check you out. A lot of kids are like-we're not doing anything, we're just studying, but if you have the wrong kind of sticker outside your door, you'll get knocks-"We smell something in the hall."  Just since the alcohol policy, anti-drug policy, and our thing has been going on, they really... the day he denied us I know a bunch of kids got busted.<br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther):</B>  Prohibition has never ever ever been shown to work. It's counter-productive; it's a harmful policy that doesn't minimize the harm of drug use.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Do you have anything to say about or in response to your opposition's views? What do they have to say, and what do you think their reasons are?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther):</B>  I think that people should look into the issues, they should do the research, they should do the reading, because if you do the reading, do the research and you take a look at some of the studies and some of the things that the government uses to oppose all of these things, you'll see that the things that they are using as backup are just poor science, hysteria and rhetoric.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> A lot of the comments we get are "It's illegal. You don't understand that it is illegal." I do understand that it is illegal.  We are not about using an illegal substance; we are about changing the laws so we don't have to do something that it is illegal.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>  I have a big problem with, one of things is about Dr. Simone, is that they use every reason, every cause of prohibition that we want to change as a reason not to allow us to do it. "Well it's illegal, well criminals are involved." All those things will not be if our group is successful in it's goals.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>If your petition is unsuccessful will you keep fighting? How dedicated are you?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Oh yeah, we will fight and we will bug and we will make sure no one forgets about this until we get recognition. We're here to stay and we will fight until we are recognized. I'm here for another four years, so at least another four years. [laughs] Once we are 81 we can stop.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>How strong is New York's marijuana legislation; how pro-marijuana is New York State?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>  It is decriminalized under an ounce.  You get a ticket, you don't get put in jail, but New York is still a fairly conservative state.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> Right now, in the state assembly, there is one guy, there are a few people that are for medical legalization, but can't find a co-sponsor in the senate. So, with only having a uni-house bill, there is no chance of it getting passed. But he can propose it just to make it symbolic, like get people talking about medical marijuana.  If you go to a state like California, a lot of people are starting to see the advantages of medical marijuana. People who have been using it for medicine who have just gotten ragged on.  I mean, you read DRC net and you see.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> Polls of Americans on the question of medical marijuana issue-over 85% of Americans support legalizing marijuana for medicinal use.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> We need to make sure that politicians know that it is not that politically unfit a move.  Right now, it's a big issue, and hopefully it gets taken care of.<br> <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> The politicians are way behind the opinions of the people as far as the issue of medical marijuana is concerned.  The federal government can admit that it is wrong, it's been harassed in California-the four mayors in San Francisco, Oakland, Santa Cruz and another city have all asked President Clinton to leave the buyers club alone.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Marijuana is still a Schedule 1 drug.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#157;</A></a><br></I><dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B>  Right, which is ridiculous.  There are bills, Marijuana Prevention Act, and Marijuana Deterrence Act,<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#135;</A></a> in front of Congress now, under which any doctor who would prescribe medical marijuana would lose their license to prescribe medicine, even if [marijuana] was legal in that state.  The doctors are scared, [politicians] are using scare tactics.<br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther): </B> The thing is,  now,  they can get as extreme as they want. The more extreme that the drug warriors get, the easier it is going to be to overturn this silly policy. Newt Gingrich is calling for the death penalty for people bringing two ounces or more of marijuana into the United States.<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A></a><br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>Where did you hear that?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther): </B> Well, you know, it's around.  He's trying to get this bill passed.  Let them get as crazy as they want, because it's only going to make them look more extreme.  Newt, he criticizes Clinton's drug plan, and Barry McCaffrey, the drug czar, is a ten year plan, and Newt Gingrich says that's too long. He wants to rid the country of illicit drugs by 2001, which is ridiculous.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B>The government just spent $200 million to get drugs out of the prisons in the U.S. If the government can't keep drugs out of prison, which has barbed wires, brick walls, and guards with guns (which is nothing like our borders), how do they think they can keep it out of the country?<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> Regarding, just for our clarity, what sources are you looking at for your information?  You noted www.marijuananews.com, DRC net [sites mentioned during the RCC meeting]. . .</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B>The NORML page has good information. The problem with the mainstream media is that they don't report anything that is pro-drug. The media, right now, is in cahoots, is the lapdog of the drug warriors.  Every now and then, you get an exception to that, but for the most part, to get the news of things that are going on in the movement, you have to go to other sources.<br><dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> If you look at the coverage we have gotten, we have been called the pot club. They do cuts to intentionally make us look bad. All except FOX [who covered the rally].<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B>  You look, for instance, [CNN's web site] allows you do personal news, and I happen to do a search on Marijuana all the time, and the only news they ever do on marijuana is people getting busted.<br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Lotlikar):</B>  If you want books, Marijuana Reconsidered  has been out for a long, the first comprehensive study of marijuana, a very good book. Marijuana: Myth and Fact, that's the newest one, it's gotten so much publicity, it's such a good book, they really outline it well, and it's by two doctors and a professor.  Anything by Ed Rosenthal, he has a bunch of books, William F. Buckley, Jr., he's so far to the right, it's amazing.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther): </B> It's still personal freedoms, that's what it's all about, he's an editor of National Review.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT: </B>It's been accused that marijuana smokers have lower GPA's; what's your reaction to this?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> I like how Simone quoted these supposed statistical studies.<br>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> I didn't see any sources in the <U>Reporter</U><A NAME="8.8"><A HREF="#8">&#131;</A></a> or either of its two recent drug related articles.</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> He also declined to name any universities with the gun shootings.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar):</B> He shoots from his hip, and just makes stuff up. I don't know anyone who has been shot here or at U of R who have been shot. Rochester just isn't that dangerous a city.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Gunther):</B> As far as the academic thing, that just doesn't hold up.<br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B>We have kids in the club that are 4.0 students.<br>  <dd><B>RCC  (Gunther): </B> There have been studies done in Jamaica that show heavy users, where people who use are at the same level or even sometimes making more money or at a higher level in their career. I don't think anything's ever been done that shows that people who use marijuana have lower GPA's. Obviously people who abuse it may, but that's a different thing.  That's the same for anyone who abuses anything.<br> <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B> Not to get down on art majors, but they always think that anybody in this building is from the art school. Like when I went up to his office to talk to [Simone], he said "Oh, you must be in the art school" because I have long hair-first words he said to me.<br><center><IMG  width = 200 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/bath.gif"><br></center>  <dd><I><B>GDT:</B> What's your major?</I><br>  <dd><B>RCC (Lotlikar): </B> MIS [Management Information Systems].

Official club recognition will inevitability [sic] lead to on-campus and off-campus publicity implying that RIT approves of drugs and drug use by students.  You and your fellow club members may not intent [sic] this effect, but there is ample evidence from previous experience in this and other campus communities that there will be widespread publicity of university recognition of a club which advocates legalization of marijuana use and that most, if not all, of the publicity will imply that the university condones drug use by its students.  It is also clear that such publicity will encourage the dangerous criminal elements connected with drug consumption in our society to come on the RIT campus and make contacts with students with the intention of selling them illegal drugs."
