I knew Michael Thomas briefly, I took a ballet class of his several years ago, it was all I could fit into my hectic schedule. I had heard that he had passed away last October, but I guess it never seemed real until I sat in that theatre and watched scores of dances choreographed by him in the days of his health.<br> <dD>Sitting in that theatre's darkness imersed in the sights and sounds of his trade, I finally realized his death. Just as teachers and classmates will gather around to fill up a card with good cheer to ailing friends in the hospital, I realized that my presence in that theatre was my signature on his farewell, just as everyone else there who had once known him was signing in their presence.<br> <dd>I never really knew him, but I knew that he cared about his students and he cared about his art. As I knew him, he was encoraging and thoughtful. In years to come, when thoughts of him may drift through my waking hours, I will remember him fondly as I once considered him fondly in his life. The tribute was a perfect reminder of life's absences, and a perfect goodbye to a man held dear to many in the RIT community.<br> <dd>Thank you for your life Michael Thomas, you will be missed.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
