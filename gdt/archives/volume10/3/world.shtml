Not only have we been given access to a computer and scanner that we can use (We will hug him and pet him and call him George...)<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> for as long as we exist, RIT's Computer Science House and the Glorious Commune of Acheron have given Hell's Kitchen office space, allowing GDT to have a permanent base. Of course, since we now have a home and are no longer forced to wander the deserts,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> all of the equipment and literature we've acquired over the last three years can be put to good use.<br><dd>Military intelligence and weapons training manuals, TVs, VCRs, oscilloscopes, games of Twister, Sea Monkeys.... Once we got everything into one place, we realized what we simply had to have: a war room. But what war room is complete without a globe? To that end, we set about to get one the old fashioned way: we'd steal it.<br><dd>Rule number one in creating and making a subversive and officially unsupported publication work is to act like you know what you're doing. Thanks to western civilization's attitude of "mind your own business" this works in just about any situation; walk into a room and look like you shouldn't be there and you'll have security on you in no time. Act like you own the place and you do.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a><br><dd>Using this simple technique the staff members of GDT and Hell's Kitchen have gained access to rooms and equipment that we really shouldn't have access to. Take for example the various Neibliums.<br><dd>First mentioned during Religious Marathon week where we related our discussions with Thor on the nature of belief while lost in the netherworlds under some of RIT's academic buildings, we have bravely ventured there several times in the past.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#131;</A></a> Of course the Wagner (pronounced Vaaaagner) operas sung off-key by the dwarfs really push us to the edge of sanity, but it can really be quite useful.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/1.1.gif"><br><dd>OK, that's not entirely true. The most interesting thing I ever emerged from the underworld with was a spool of copper wire, and I had to barter with some slimy green icky thing that kept calling my high school ring "our precious." I was more than happy to give it to him for the copper, but the weird thing was that when he put it on he just disappeared. Weird. But I'm REALLY off topic here. Sorry. I just thought you might appreciate this not being a footnote.<br><dd>Anyway, when we needed a globe, of course our first stop in shopping was the underworld. It's easy to get to. Climb into an elevator (Like I'd tell you which one. I'm not going to be responsible when some poor frat guy thinks he's cool, goes to Middle Earth and goes insane from all the operas), take it to the top floor, hit all the buttons, and while it's going down, jump up and down. If it doesn't get stuck between the 1st and 2nd floor, repeat this whole procedure. If it does get stuck, ring the bell twice and the car should start up again. Eventually the car will stop again. When the doors open, welcome to the hidden world below. To your left you'll see a red-headed physicist in a wheelchair. He is the person who uses the winch to move the elevator. Give him a drink of water and he'll help ya out.<br><dd>Of course, you don't always end up in the same place. I've tried to draw a map of the various places I've gotten to from the same starting location, but it ended up looking like a hyper cube, and since the Doctor says such things can't be done I think I did something wrong.<br><dD>This particular time I ended up in what looked like the storage area in the basement of a dilapidated, industrial kinda building. After giving the elevator operator a glass of Fountainhead&#153; bottled water<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#181;</A></a> (In a voice that'd come from a repressed worker from the 1800's: "You're always so nice. You give me drinks of water."),  I started snooping around. There were a bunch of doors and all were locked save one which opened into a passageway that led farther into the structure of the facility.<br><dd>There I discovered stacks of various sized sea monkeys (yummy), marble (cool), some turn-of-the-century brass chandeliers (sayy) and an airlift gurney (huh?). I took the gurney, some sea monkeys and the cool three inch diameter spherical bulb covers from the chandeliers.  I can think of a million uses for them. My own snow-globes, for instance (Rosebud!). I can have a box of 'em when I'm feeling especially melancholy and lamenting my lost childhood.<br><dd>Anyway, I popped the other storage doors and found me a wee bookcase, some unassembled, pre-fab office furniture that I didn't want, and the globe. Ahhhh, the globe. The dusty acrylic orb had a 32 inch diameter and was set in a massive brass ring, adding another three inches to its girth. We're talking a really big globe here. I could see both Liechtenstein and Tuva clearly marked on it's surface.<br><dd>The brass ring sits and can roll in the base, thus providing the X-Y rotation. I immediately knew that this was THE GLOBE that we needed, but I was torn. The globe definitely wouldn't fit into my Beetle, so I asked a one eyed dwarf who happened by singing <I>Wozzeck</I>, by Alban Berg, for advice.<br><dd>It so happened that he had a blazer and using my stunning personality and innate people skills I convinced him to let me borrow it. Luckily it fit into the elevator and I popped back into the normal world, ears ringing from that night's atonal aural assault.<br><dd>Being three in the afternoon I had little trouble getting it to the blazer parked in a spot marked "ETC Vehicles only"...after all, I acted like I was supposed to be pushing a three foot globe in an oak frame and fitted with brass across one of RIT's parking lots. Why would I have any problems? Sure, there was the Campus Security guy perched up on top of the Imaging Science building who saw me, but I just nodded my head to him and he went back to watching the parking lot to make sure no one's car was broken into.<br><dd>After using the little guy's scraper to get all the tickets off the windows, I moved the seat back, took off the extenders on the peddles, and loaded it up and zoomed it off to our super secret war-room in waiting.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>It will be a glorious sight. We've already got most of the equipment we'll need. Of course, if just anyone walked in it would look like a normal room, but hit the secret button and BLAM-O! Quick-o, change-o, the war room appears. Couches flip over and wing backed chairs with the Chief of Staff strapped in appear and a huge mahogany table lowers from the ceiling.<br><dd>From the closet emerges Charleston Heston. His job is just to walk around and say anything he wants...to add to the atmosphere.<br><dd>On the desk that folds out from the wall is our Red Phone. It is connected directly to Dorthy Brown's (the person in charge of RIT's calendar of event's, CalendaRIT) super secret line...the one she answers when she's "on the other line" or "out of the office." Unfortunately it's under a bell jar and sealed with a vacuum, so we really can't use it. Just as well, really. She hasn't been a help to us in the past.<br><dd>The Def Con indicator is our master stroke. Controlled by another computer named Joshua, it has five levels: 5 indicates we're in a state of porn, but this has never happened. We even don't know if there is a bulb in there. Level four indicates Mario Cart, at which point huge monitors are lowered from the ceiling so we can play N64. Level three indicates Mamma's Family is on the air and that we're headed for trouble. This might seem obscure, but if you think back to your cartoon filled Saturdays, you'll remember that when Mamma's Family came on, you knew that all the cartoons were done for the day and that the world just became that much darker. Level two is Golden Eye, and Level 1 is, of course, Global Thermal Nuclear War. The only glitch with the Def Con system is that the computer, Joshua, always says, "Hello Dr. Falcon. I don't want to do this anymore," and shuts down. This means we have to change the bulbs in the indicator by hand, but we still think it's a good system and are dedicated to making it work.<br><dd>But the globe would finish the room. How else can we plot our expansion? Sure, it's fun to use golf clubs to push little pieces around on a Risk board, but a globe is so much more impressive. Even if it did nothing but sit in the corner taking up space and collecting dust, people would walk into the room, ignore the table, Chiefs of Staff seat belted to their chairs, and Charleston Heston, and they'd say, "God DAMN! What a kick ass war room! Where's the firing switch and why are there sea monkeys in the water cooler?<br><dd>After a bit of fidgeting with the globe I fit it into the elevator and started to take it up. The problems started once I tried to actually get it into the room. I took the base off and it wouldn't fit through the frame. OK. It had little casters that were set in, so I took them off and, huzzah! it fit with room to spare. The globe, however posed a more serious problem. It wouldn't fit. As it wasn't fit with casters and remained a sphere no matter which way I turned it I was beginning to get frustrated. Imagine a room filled with type A personalities, held down in their chairs, all yelling at you on how you should go about getting it in the door.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Of course, if the globe were accurate, it would be a little flattened at the poles and I could get it though, but no use complaining about centrifugal forces and the role they should play when making really big acrylic globes. I'd rather throw it out than bring it back to that horrid basement where I'm sure the dwarfs had moved onto something mind numbingly bad, like show tunes by Andrew Lloyd Weber. Ugggghhhhh.<br><dd>I took the pins off the hinges of doors and tried again. UHG. And now it's stuck. So if I push really hard, it seems springy enough...<br><dd>CRACK!<br><dd>There goes the mid western US. Oh, well. I never liked them anyway. It's in.<br><dd>So the world is ours, and we only had to destroy the desert states, and a little bit of Mexico.  Bru-ha-ha-ha. Watch for us as we start annexing land in an area near you!<br>  </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#248;</A> Not a type-o.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> Thank you, Mr. Diablo.
