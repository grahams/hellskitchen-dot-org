From the age of ten or eleven, cars slowing down as they passed me, offering me lifts and varied other pleasures. After which, many would begin to pace about me in their cars, following me, thinking I did not notice. I became alarmed by the recent trends and took what actions I could to escape such probing predators when I could identify them.<br><dd>As I grew older, the problems worsened. The scavengers stalked, and I, the prey, grew eyes to know at a glance what their next move was. One little flicker of the eyes to know. Does he want something? Is he dangerous? Whenever the answers became yes, the next question had no time for hesitation. What are my choices and what are the probable outcomes of those choices?<br><dd>If you panic, you make a wrong move. If you make a wrong move, they spring the trap.<br> <dd>It was easy enough to avoid most who scavenged from cars, but sometimes encounters on foot would become too close for comfort-a dangerously drunken man tried to kill a companion of mine after he (my friend) had taken responsibility as my "boyfriend" (a lie to help protect me from the man) because the man had been following us around for a few hours prior to this. The man had pulled a knife on my friend's back after he had clearly lost in a fist fight over who would "own" me. If someone hadn't called the police, there is no telling how things would have ended for me that day. I was only thirteen and puberty wasn't to strike me for another two years....<br><dd>In the wake of my present days I shy away from the sun's comfort and embrace the darkness as my only mistress for the light offers a certain kind of death that I feel suits me not. But these days my mistress is a danger to me as well. When I was younger, there was certainly an element of danger to the night, but never so much as today. The last time I ventured forth without male escort around, at one or two in the morning, a car in the distance must have noticed my presence by the side of the road, for they sped up and stopped ten feet away as I emerged from under a tree. Two large men in their mid-twenties stepped out of their vehicle and began walking towards me. Unbeknownst to them I had a secret, hidden beneath the foliage of the tree. A rather large, fierce-looking secret.<br> <dd>As my German shepherd stepped forward from beneath her hiding spot, the two men suddenly looked alarmed and quickly ran back to their car. As they slammed the doors behind, one yelled back at me, "We just wanted to fuck your dog!" and sped off. I had certainly been safe in her care, but she is dead now, and her corpse can be of no use to me. The night is as dangerous a place as the day now, and I can find no rest.<br><dd>Up until a few years ago, I still clung to a small space of naivet&#233;. Wary of strangers I was, but wariness of friends was something I hadn't even conceived of. This was quickly rectified by the first month of college when I was assaulted by someone I thought was a friend of mine, in his car, when he had offered me a lift. For the first time I was taken by surprise. My mind, which had always flown so rapidly through case scenarios to offer my best chance of escape, abandoned me. I was alone in this, and I was utterly incapacitated by shock.<br><dd>From all of these things I have learned and adapted. I have become the perfect prey for a hunter who wishes a challenge. But these are no hunters, they are scavengers. They wish for only the easy targets, they eat fear, confusion, and hesitation-all traits I can no longer afford to own. I am no longer allowed to trust unless that trust has been earned to an extreme degree. I am no longer allowed to let my guard down. I am no longer allowed to rest, because I am what was termed the third "failure" in my family. A failure to be male. A failure to be a predator. For the fleeting moments of sperm and egg I am to be blamed and hounded for something that has absolutely nothing to do with who I am: my sex.<br><dd>So I must be a femi-nazi, for that is what they call women merely disgusted by the current state of affairs. I must be a femi-nazi, because I don't hate men...I hate what some of them do. I hate being chided for my sex as being illogical, weak, overly emotional-feelings I can not have. I hate always having to disprove the assumption that just because I am a young female, I must be immature, naive, and unintelligent. I hate having to ward off potential loved-ones who insist on protecting me, and fighting my battles for me while I am supposed to watch on in a state of impotence of control over my own life.<br> <dd>Honestly, I don't wish for your pity. I want your understanding. I am a woman, and as such, this is the meal that has been forced onto my plate. As my parents used to tell me, "You don't have to like it, you just have to eat it."How appropriate.<br> <dd>I ask only, not to be judged by the women you might have known, and I will promise not to judge you by the men I have known. Remember that I am a person and not a people. Just because the designs seem similar, it does not necessarily mean that we were all cut from the same cloth. We are each individuals, men and women alike, and we should be treated as such. You don't know where I've come from and you don't know where I've been. Just accord me and my kind the same respect you might offer up to a man, at least until you know better.<br><dd>All I want now is to be able to wander, free of the potential sexual snares. I want to lay down my head and rest a while, for the exhaustion of daily life has beaten me down. I want a freedom most men take for granted.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
