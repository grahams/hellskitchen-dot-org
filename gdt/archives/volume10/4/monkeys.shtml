I recently started a small Sea Monkey colony in some Fountainhead&#153; bottled water. How could I not? That massive two liter cerulean blue bottle screamed out in its containery way to be more than a subtle reference to an Ayn Rand novel sitting on the bookshelf of the Hell's Kitchen's office. It wanted greatness. It wanted to become what its name destined it to be. But if I knew then what I know now.... Well...let's just say things would be different.<br><dd>When I began the colony, I carefully followed the discordant directions placed all over the packages....<p><I>5.2 	And as I opened the Fountainhead and dumped out most of the water I called, "Come and see!" And the staff saw as a third of the waters were poured out. When I opened the package, the staff cried "Let us see!" and I showed onto them the wiggy light, book of instructions, and elixirs. And when I opened the Water Purifier, behold, there came a great earthquake and the sun became as black as sack cloth, and the moon became as blood.<br> 8.1 	When I broke the seal on the Instant Life packet, there was silence in the office for about half an hour. Fine mists of Powdered Monkeys and Powdered Monkeys Starting Fluid shifted slowly through the air around me. The moment of truth arrived and verilly, I inhaled.</I><p> <IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/1.1.gif"><br><dd>I have contracted a case of the sea monkeys, tiny creatures imbedded snugly in the mucous membranes of my nose, waiting for me to sneeze or cough, thereby releasing the waiting hoards into the air around me. This fiendish brood has turned me into the next Typhoid Mary.<br> <dd>Sure the package says that Sea Monkeys will only eat the special Sea Monkey Food provided in the packages, but unlike my sea monkeys, I wasn't born yesterday. I know of the gluttonous appetites contained within those translucent sperm-shaped bodies. Those little bastards are as voracious as tiger sharks, with less discerning tastes.<br> <dd>You may ask yourself what kind of damage could a macroscopic airborne brine shrimp do to the everyday world? Well, given the right atmospheric conditions (high humidity, high concentrations of silver nitrate, an average Rochester day), a phenomena known as <I>Artema voltronicus</I><A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a>occurs, in which the millions of airborne sea monkeys coalesce in one area and form a massive humanoid entity. This being stands nine feet tall and floats inches above the ground, really freaking out the resident physicists.<br> <dd>(No, I'm serious! You should see them banging their heads in the corner trying to wrap their head around it. They're willing to accept a nine-foot tall gestalt sea monkey, but have it hover above the ground? No sale.)<br><dd>Regardless, this creature from the darkest stygian nightmares of sociopathic children seeks one thing and one thing only-revenge. You might think that the sea monkeys have only a simple basal ganglia and cannot remember faces that were distorted by water and acrylic. Wrong. In this gestalt phase of their existence, which all sea monkeys (the ones who survive, that is) go through prior to total enlightenment, the individual basal gangliae combine to form an intricate neural network that rivals the complexity of the human brain. They remember you!<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>Yes, the instructions say that shaking them up will not hurt them and is, in fact, like a fun roller-coaster ride, but they remember all the times you shook up the water, pulverizing their little bodies. All the times you forgot to feed them in favor of gallivanting about on one of your numerous sexual escapades, all the times you let the cat drink out of the container.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a>They recall the anguish involving gelatin and a seven pound can of beans. They weep (as best an aquatic creature can) at the thoughts of fallen comrades, those dehydrated masses who could not survive the harsh conditions of un-purified, chlorinated, fluoride enhanced water that you inflicted upon them. They know. This memory is genetically encoded, special in nature. When the Instant Life package hits the liquid, you can almost hear the anguished screams of thousands of souls calling out to the universe.<br><dd>"Father, the sleepers have awoken!"<br><dd>The sea monkeys of today recall the collective past of sea monkeys worldwide, all the way back to 1962 when the first Sea Monkey kits came to the hands of sadistic little children...like your parents. They know the hardships of their ancestors,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a>who were powerless to defend themselves against an onslaught of opposable thumbs. But no more. They're bigger than you now, and all those years of watching "Kung Fu" with David Caradine were for naught, because as a coalescent being, they can alter their shape. Any punch, kick, or fired projectile easily passes through the Gestalt Brine Shrimp (GBS), rendering you powerless and looking quite silly.<br> <dd>On a daily basis I visit the colony I created, desperately clinging to the hope that perhaps these creatures have a shred of compassion and will convince their comrades to leave my nose to rejoin their clan in the bottle. But really I'm not fooling myself too much. If they knew it wouldn't rebound off the interior blue plastic walls of the world that surrounds them, those little gits would probably be crapping in their hands and throwing it at me, and I don't want to think about what the parasites in my bronchial tubes are doing in their free time.<br><IMG SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Besides, I think that I may have gone where science never should have, or some suitably poignant phrase you can hear in any 1950's Sci-fi flick. By hatching the Sea Monkeys, normally a gestalt creature, in a bottle of Fountainhead drinking water, their nature has changed. Those in the bottle have become rugged egoists, refusing to join with the collective. Everytime the monkey's infecting me try and join their comrades, they are cast out by the now individualist Sea Monkeys.<br><dd>But in the process, the Fountainhead Sea Monkeys (<I>Artema solitarus</I>) are slowly weakening from their unaccustomed new lifestyle of aloofness and rampant capitalism. Great Scott, they're Republicans!<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a><br><dd>Yeah, I'm going down, but I'm taking two or three of you with me. I sneezed on the fish of the day at Wegmans. Just another airborne sea monkey making its way in the world.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/1.4.gif"><br> <dd>Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones; one of the few people who'll die before the Age of the Sea Monkey is at hand. They've got it all planned out. You think you're in control? Yes, they wig out every time you force them into the light after a long stint of darkness, but who's got whom trained? Thanks to me going where science yaddah, yaddah, yaddah, bla, bla, bla, you have been left you in the hands of some of the mightiest exoskeletal criminal master minds the world has ever seen.<br> <dd>Armed with a 16 D-Cell metal flash light, the GBS shines it in people's eyes causing momentary blindness for the lucky, blithering insanity for the unfortunate, and general wigginess for most. This allows enough time for nano-brine to enter the body of the hapless victim where they eat away at the host, multiplying at a staggering rate. When finished, they leave nothing except the bones and skin which they can manipulate to look like politicians<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a>  and media superstars like Gary Hart, Newt Gingrich, Don King, and Wilt Chamberlain, capable of fooling even the most observant mistresses and/or voters. These soon to be cultural icons are planning on taking over the world and turning the four corners area into a giant aerorium, but they can only accomplish this goal with your support.<br> <dd>To help, send $19.95 to:<br><dd>Help the Sea Monkeys Destroy Man<br><dd>PO Box 1475<br><dd>New York, New York  10019-1475<br><I>All donations are tax deductible and will help end the Age of the Primate.</I><br>   </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> And I'll form...the head!<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> "That's what happened to mine," said Clare in a quiet voice.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#135;</A> Curiously, Sea Monkeys can not recall the fate of their kind that lived short, euphoric lives in bong water.
