One such CD is the release of an untitled 4-song EP by the band Jiversmoothen (by the way, it is pronounced JIVE - ER - SMOO - THEN).<br><dd>The band consists of Dave Raymond on guitar and lead vocals, Dana Bennett on bass, and Jon Coyles on percussion. They are all from the Horseheads area in New York, which is about an hour and a half drive south of Rochester. Jon, the drummer, is a student at the U of R, so if you want information about the band you can call him at (716) 274-3211. I suggest you do, if you are interested, since this EP is not available in any stores yet and is homemade.<br><dd>Despite the low-fi production, the final product is better than many professionally produced chart-toppers. It is truly a quality production that captures the sound well (although maybe a little more tinkering on some tracks would improve things a bit).<br> <dd>At first, a clear comparison becomes evident: Weezer. Their sound is very similar, but not quite the same as Weezer. Jiversmoothen's sound is even more fifties influenced. The songs are upbeat a la Weezer's "Buddy Holly". All songs are a group effort, so there is no primary songwriter. The songs are witty and sharp; the songs are never sloppy nor do they never lose their balance.<br><dd>The first song, "Once Upon" has been played on WITR to a very responsive audience. It is a typical Jiversmoothen song: it's upbeat, optimistic, and reminds you of whatever good memories of high school you may have. The song is sung by Horseheads High School senior Dave, who proclaims, "But girl I know I'm only seventeen/But I'm convinced that you're the one for me" and other cute quips. (He also rhymes "seventeen" with "a perfect team.")"Once Upon" was a great song to play on the radio. Our first choice to play was "Jen," but Dave didn't want us to play that one. "Jen," the second song, has real star quality. It's down-home fun rock with a twist of wit and a whole lot of honesty. "Jen" is truly the highlight of the EP. It even has a rare, masterful guitar solo that truly, by some force, makes one smile.<br><dd>After "Jen" comes "Someone Else's Girl," which sounds a lot like "Surfer Girl" (the chorus sounds like "Surfer Girl's," almost note for note, even though I'm sure it was an accident) mixed with Weezer's "The World Has Turned And Left Me Here."<br><dd>The final song is "Standing." This is more straightforward rock, with a little more "Holiday" and a little less "Earth Angel." It is another girlfriend-aimed song, and, like the other three, it is bouncy, honest, witty, and really catchy without being pretentious. It is probably the best produced song on the EP.<br><dd>In all, Jiversmoothen's EP is a real gem, and I'm not just saying that because I know Jon, Dana, and Dave personally. It has quickly become one of the most played CDs in my stereo (just ask my roommate). Give Jon a call and get your hands on a copy of this great 4-song EP if you get a chance. You won't be disappointed<br><center>-Mike</center><p><B>Morcheeba: BIG CALM</B><p><dd>Morcheeba, on their new release "Big Calm," combine many elements and have a wonderful lead singer, who possesses a voice which one would die for. The lead vocalist, Skye Edwards, is a cross between jazz's leading women, Beth from Portishead, and a trip-hop version of Diana Ross.<br><dd>This Brit group combines and creates their own sound from all different genres, yet they compliment each other well. The various instrumentation, arrangements, and lovely vocals create a rich, complex, and epic-soundtrack-quality album.<br><dd>"Blindfold" is seductive trip-hop with silky smooth vocals. The song is very sing-along-able, and the added strings give it an almost epic feel. "The Sea" is a very curious song that quickly draws you in. "Part Of The Process" is a mellow, funky tune with a good bassline. The female vocals are wonderful, with very strong jazz influences.<br><dd>"Shoulder Holster" includes a sitar, samples, electronics, and other various instrumentation. It is flowing and funky. "Let Me See" is danceable, with a more electronic landscape, accompanied by a flute. It is very reminiscent of Portishead or Massive Attack. "Over and Over" is a more delicate piece, with strings and french horn. It is very mournful and short.<br><dd>"Friction," for some reason, includes a very out of place Jamaican rapper/singer. This use seems totally unnecessary and, unfortunately, it ruins the song. For some reason, the rapper reappears in "Big Calm." The bonus track almost makes up for the rapper.<br><dd>The highlights of the album are the tracks "The Sea," "Part of the Process," "Faerie Love," "Friction," and "Big Calm." "Pissin' A Watery Grave" features a well-placed sitar.<br><dd>The styles range from jazz, hip-hop, trip-hop, techno, electronic, and even Broadway-esque drama. The arrangements are well developed and feature Skye Edwards' soaring, smooth vocals.<br><dd>Morcheeba's "Big Calm" is a fine record, but it could use some better editing in bits. Skye Edwards has a beautiful voice and steals the spotlight from the rest of the band. Judging by the success of the album so far, they probably don't mind.<br><center>-Justine</center><p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white>plugg&#233;d is a weekly music column focusing on the newest releases, providing accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information, coupled with informative and informed opinions.
