The moment you've all been waiting for!  The main event.  The big duke-a-roo!  Who will win, you say?  Watch and see for yourself.  Place all bets, secure all loose children and, as the saying goes....<p>LLLLLLLLLLEEETS GET RRRREADY TO RRRRUMBLEEEEEEEEEE!!!<p>	First up, some choice bouts submitted by <I>Melancholy Homewrecker's</I> own Clare Terni:<p><UL><LI> President Al Simone vs. a studio major armed with a pallete knife and a craft student with an arc welder. (I would PAY to see that)<LI> Monica Lewinsky vs. a coffee roll shaped like Princess Diana. Whoever melts first due to the glare of the flashbulbs is the loser.<li> Daniel Day Lewis vs. Doris Day.</UL><p>	Next up, a few matches arranged by Josh Vincentz:<UL><LI> Dave Thomas vs. Ben Stein (keep your 'ludes handy).<LI> Hunter S. Thompson and an ether soaked handkerchief vs the decaying corpse of William S. Burroughs.<LI> The first mom from "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" vs. the second mom from "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"<li> Tonya Harding vs Paula Jones in a bikini clad, Jello pit free-for-all. (Winner will be crowned "Skankiest Ho on the Whole Freakin' Continent")</UL><p>And finally, a few that I'd like to see:<p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/tourist1.gif"><br></td><td valign = top align = right><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/tourist2.gif"><br></td></tr></table> <UL><LI>Maron Barry hopped up on crack vs. Sonny when he's "Koo-Koo for Co-Co Puffs"</ul></td><td width = 250 valign = top><ul><LI> Right-wing, gun toting, abortion-doctor-executing Jesus freaks vs. any random sampling of hillbilly-redneck-preteens who have been belittled by their classmates and have access to daddy's hunting rifles. (I'd just say that when you give a six year old a shotgun for Christmas, you have absolutely no right to say, "Oh why did this happen" when he offs innocent little girls and a teacher in a schoolyard. "Today we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Honey, after we sight-in, we'll go slaughter some innocent animals for their heads and the meager amounts of meat we can shave off their corpses to make into bad tasting jerky, so that we may honor the birth of the Messiah.")  <LI> Tractor pull featuring Senator Jesse Helms on a Farm-all vs. Uncle Jesse from TV's "The Dukes of Hazzard" on a John Deere.<br><center><table><tr><td valign = top><IMG  width = 200 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/tourist3.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><font size = +1><center><I>SORRY CHARLIE!</I></font size></center><br></td></tr></table></center> <LI> Pillsbury Dough-Boy vs. the Snuggle washing machine bear. (on a side note, my friend Stacey was dismayed as a child when the spin cycle would end and she and her brother would huddle expectantly around the washer lid, in hopes that that furry little bastard would pop up with all the April-fresh socks and underwear, to bestow upon her the graces of static-free linens.  Sadly, the fucker was a no-show.  If he breaks his fight contract this evening, Kelly "The Bull" Gunter will send out Moose and Squirrel to break his kneecaps.)<li> <I>Reporter Magazine</I>  vs. Quark X-Press.</UL><p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td valign = top width = 500>	<I>Sunday!
