I studied the moon as it grind silently through space, rising slowly above the partly-cloudy summer sky, and was startled when I noticed that the moon was beginning to rotate, as gradually as it rose.  A flare of red beamed from the newly exposed edge, expanding until, in the middle, there was a flash of pyrophoric white, a flash that never decayed and radiated like any star would if it were that close.<br><dd>It was fascinating.  I imagined the faces of people across the darkened hemisphere who would be looking up at the night sky turning brighter and brighter as the moon revealed its unseen side.<br><dd>The colors extruded out into a column, deliberately placed, but contorted across the curved surface.  It looked like it might have been forming a red and white "X," but when the moon had fully turned, the image was far more graphic.<br><dd>It was a red crucifix with a stark white depiction of Jesus and was completely disturbing.  My intelligence was stripped by a trillion synapses all relaying the same message: "ThisIsTheApocolypse ThisIsTheApocolypse ThisIsTheApocolypse ThisIsTheApocolypse ThisIs..."<br><dd>There was only one thing I was prepared to do in this situation, something instinctual.  I repented.  As I purged my sins and gave myself to Jesus, I felt the weight and even the need of this world leave my body and absorb into the ground.<br><dd>While meditating, I stared off into the clouds and saw a massive fleet of very large, triangular and dark spacecraft cruise across the sky only slightly above tree-top level.  They scattered, disappearing quickly over the horizon now cradling the setting moon.<br></multicol></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images4/ufo.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign =top><table><tr><td valign = top><multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>I shot to my feet.  I couldn't speak and I wanted to scream.  I wanted to yell so loud that the world could hear: "It's a trick!  They're messing with all of our minds!"  Nothing but dry gasping escaped.<br><dd>The true knowledge of the events that had transpired did not comfort me.  It wasn't the Second Coming, but it still looked like the end of life on Earth.  It was evil.  It was happening too fast.  There was nothing that could be done to stop it.<br><dd>A distant, high pitched electrical whine entered directly into my brain and rose into registers that could only be felt as a deep rooted headache.  I was suddenly surrounded by the brightest white I had ever seen.  It stretched into infinity in all directions.  Thick neon red lines zigzagged and pulsated quickly with the white, flashing back and forth.  I heard a thin rumble far away, getting closer.  The flashes quickened as the noise grew nearer.  I saw giant waves of earth approach.  The ground shook violently under my feet.<br><dd>Then it all stopped.<br><dd>I walked into the house and turned on the television.  The early morning news was on and I flipped from news channel to news channel for hours until dawn, but there was no mention of earthquakes, Christ or flying saucers.<br><dd>Then I woke up late at night on the lawn of a split level ranch in the suburbs under a full moon.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
