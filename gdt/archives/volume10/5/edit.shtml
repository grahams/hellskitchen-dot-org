Maybe it's because we've grown complacent and accepting of our rights-like our acceptance of electricity in our post-industrial society-but it's rare to find a teen or twenty-something enamored by the document.<br><dD>Imagine yourself in the time when the founding fathers were drafting the Bill of Rights and Constitution. They were not only revolutionaries, but idealists and intellectuals. Of course these traits are laughable in the latter part of the 20th century, having gone out of style with communism and hippies.<br><dd>Still, those people believed in something with an almost religious fanaticism. They fought, not only for their independence, but for a new way of doing things. With our sense of relativism and seeing nothing but differing shades of grey, could any of us in today's world find the moral righteousness to fight for something new, something we believed was right?<br><dd>Students in the 1960's were fired upon by their own countrymen and died. Today the same people who dared try and change the world are mocked for their idealism. Better to do nothing and live in an undesirable world than risk trying.<br><dd>But there is still hope. When students dare care enough to do something, it means that the fire that makes us all human has not been extinguished for lack of adversity. We seek out and make our adversaries, whether they be genuine dragons or windmills, and it is through adversity that we defy the universe. We may not rail against the injustices in the world, but if a single student dares laugh at a bigot rather than accept their opinion as valid in the spirit of multiculturalism, the world becomes that much lighter.<br><dd>When I heard of the Rochester Cannabis Coalition's planned protest over being denied recognition as a club by RIT's president Simone, I was pleased that people were doing something. After all, I write what I do because I have grown weary of protests; I've rallied and spoke before groups nearly my entire scholastic life. When blank, emotionless eyes stare back at you, or only one in ten people understands the true reason for a given protest, the desire to organize falls, but not the desire to see change.<br><dd>If one person laughs at racism, the world is better. For myself, I hope that by pointing out how absurd we've allowed the lives we live to become, people will stop adding to the absurdity. Even the hate mail and threats GDT receives become victories, because we have moved one person into action; we helped them overcome the inertia of acceptance.<br><dd>But when groups like RCC begin to beat their war drums and use the First Amendment as a rallying cry, I feel sick inside. The RCC is an organization which, though denied club status on RIT, is allowed to assemble freely, say what they wish, and even hang signs on campus (I feel compelled to point out that Hell's Kitchen has been denied the ability to hang signs on RIT). How are their rights being denied? They aren't. It is simply a case of individuals being denied what they want and throwing a tantrum. What better way to get sympathy for a cause than to say their rights are being denied?<br><dd>To me such tactics are not only untruthful and aimed at distracting people from the real issues at hand, but are demeaning to the Constitution. I know: I used the same tactics while in Junior High and High School. I knew what I did then and why I did it, but I can't help but wonder if RCC really believes it is their Constitutional right to be a club.<br><dd>For any movement to be truly successful, its actions have to spring from motives consistent with its goals. The ends do not justify the means if the means corrupt the ends.<br> <dd>Remember this the next time you don't get your way.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
