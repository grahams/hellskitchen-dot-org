At first, it was greeted by responses like, "it's fun music that makes you want to dance," "refreshingly fun," and "it sounds completely different from today's music, but it somehow works." It also received responses like "no one will listen to it," "not heavy enough," and "too inaccessible." Upon the release of the Amazing Royal Crowns' new self-titled CD, similar comments are being spoken.<br><dd>They are the answer to the question, "whatever happened to rock and roll?" Rock and roll is back. Jerry Lee Lewis-style pre-roadhouse blues and rockabilly energy. They are not retro. They are not making a statement. "Rockabilly, when it first started out, was punk rock. Nobody was doing it," singer Jason "King" Kendall states. "To us, rockabilly is punk rock."<br><dd>This belief is evident in listening to their music. They truly stand by this belief, combining great lyrics, sing along choruses, and pure, "Great Balls Of Fire" energy. Their shows have been heartily praised by the press, having won many awards in their hometown: Boston. They are currently opening for the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.<br><dd>The CD opens with "Shiverin In The Corner," a lively, upbeat, bluesy number that provides a perfect introduction to the band. The second song, "Do The Devil" (as in "do the locomotion" only more fun) is the single of the album. "Do The Devil" is another great song, it just makes you want to dance like it was 1955.The rest of the album is similar, with songs that sound like much of the early rock music from the early 1950s. Unfortunately, most of the album sounds like the first songs. All the songs are good, and the album does not sound monotonous, I would expect nothing more or less, but all of the songs sound very similar. They're great tunes, though.<br><dd>In all, the Amazing Royal Crowns new self-titled album is great rockabilly/early 1950s rock that accentuates the "punkish" elements of this style. Their music is lively and fun, yet smart and knowledgeable.<br><center>-Mike</center><p><B>PULP- THIS IS HARDCORE</B><p><dd>Pulp is Jarvis Cocker's creation which first appeared in 1983.  The group is from Sheffield, England, and Jarvis is the only member who has remained constant throughout the years and changing line ups.  They have released:  <I>It</I>,<I> Freaks</I>, <I>Separations</I>, <I>Intro</I>, the <I>Gift Recordings</I>, <I>His N' Hers</I>, <I>Different Class</I>, and many singles and b-sides which have been put together by their old record company after the success of <I>Different Class</I>, and now <I>This Is Hardcore.</I><br><dd>For many years Pulp has had an underground, indie following in England.  They had many problems with their former record company which added to the difficulty in getting recognition. There were financial and legal difficulties, among many other things, which held up recording and releasing anything.<br><dd>Jarvis Cocker is the interesting, witty, and unusual lead singer, main lyric writer, film buff, film director, and frontman of Pulp.  He writes in the voice of one from the town where he was raised, Sheffield. The overall themes of the songs throughout the years have been love, sex, death, and regular, boring daily life. Often, his songs take on tiny details: a failed love affair, a particular room, a death at the disco, afternoon tea, etc. Pulp are very British, but on their most recent effort, they are not so narrowly fixed.<br><dd><I>Different Class</I> was a large hit in England and Europe. Their single "Common People" has become a theme song in England, just as "My Heart Will Go On" has become a theme song here. Pulp have become that huge in the UK.<br><dd>They eventually disappeared a bit for working on the next album. Pulp's long time guitar and violin player, Russell Senior, left. Many other changes have occurred after the success of <I>Different Class</I>.<br><dd><I>This Is Hardcore</I> has a very different overall sound from <I>Different Class</I>. As Jarvis sings during "The Fear," "This is the sound of someone losing the plot making out that they're okay and they're not." Quite a few tracks are foreboding, claustrophobic and sound like their earlier work, but with a better, fuller sound.<br><center>-Justine</center><p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white>plugg&#233;d is a weekly music column focusing on the newest releases, providing accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information, coupled with informative and informed opinions.
