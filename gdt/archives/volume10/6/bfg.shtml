There were some simple and interesting tests to determine this (these tests were effective in the same way that testing whether a woman was a witch was effective). It went something like this...<br><dd>Throw your child into a freshly stoked fire. If the child screams and runs up the chimney, the little fiend was a changeling. If, however, your beloved babe screams and writhes in agony, he is either your true born, a Jew in the flames of Nazi hell, or both, and now he is either maimed for life or dying a hideously painful death, depending on how quickly you come to his fiery aid.<br><dd>Testing for midgets is similar, but not quite as messy. The testing runs in stages or levels of midgetry which must be passed successively.<p><B>Test 1:</B> Put the questionable babe in front of the TV and pop in "The Court Jester" if he does not scream during the "Black Fox" song, check his hearing and vision. If his hearing and vision seem unimpaired go on to the next test, otherwise stop here secure in the knowledge that your child is not a freakshow.<p><B>Test 2:</B> Welcome to the next level. Introduce your child to Barney. If you ever catch your child singing, "I love you, you love me..." bludgeon the tot immediately. This is not so much a test of midgitity as it is just a good idea. Continue to the next level.<p><B>Test 3:</B> Do they have an unnatural love of the color green and an unnaturally sounding Irish baby gurgle? If yes, they may be a midget, continue on.<p><B>Test 4: </B>The deciding test. Do they scream (or laugh maliciously), saying something like, "Uncle Louie!" every time you open up a container of Tang. If your answer is yes, congratulations you are the proud parent of a freak.<p><dd>If your little tyke passes all tests (excluding #2), I suggest testing whether he is a changeling after taking a healthy dose of valium.<br><dd>Have a nice day.<br>	<table width = 250><tr><td valign = top align = right>		-The Bare-foot Girl<br></td></tr></table><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><font size = +3><center>Questions for the Bare-foot Girl? <br> Send them to gdt@iname.com  </font size><br><center></td></tr></table></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
