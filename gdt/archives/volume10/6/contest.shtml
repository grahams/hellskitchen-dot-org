But don't think she won just for showing up. With a score of 110 points out of a possible 160, this self-employed artist would would have challenged any undergraduate engineering student.<br><dd>Below is a copy of her machine's description:<br></td></tr></table><dd>The sleepy person drops a pillow onto the bucket.  The lever converts the downward movement of the bucket into the upward movement of the push stick.  The push stick tips the box holding the engine car.  The car starts to move and falls onto the track.  The car continues down the track until it hits the hanging pusher.  The hanging pusher pushes on the rope with the washer and pries the washer free of the crevice.  The rope with the washer has a knot tied in it that stops the rope from moving and also holds a pin.  The rope continues moving upward until the pin pops the balloon and the knot causes the rope to stop moving.  When the balloon pops open, confetti and scraps of paper with the phrase "get up!" fall all over the place.  As the rope with the washer moves up, the pulley converts that upward movement into a downward movement for the other end of the rope.  This end of the rope holds a plaster hand by a bracelet.  The plaster hand, in turn, holds a rock.  This rock smashes into the snooze button on the clock radio.  The depressed snooze button stops the noise.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes-<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
