It turns out that 3Com/USR was sued last fall by Pilot, the pen company, for trademark infringement. So, Palm Computing needed a new name for its star product. Thus Palm III was born. Still, I tend to wonder if "Palm III" was the best naming scheme they could come up with. It's very generic and left the Palm Computing line open to other pocket computer makers, such as Microsoft, to easily steal the trademark. The "Apple II" worked because who else in their right mind would name a computer after a fruit? It will be very difficult for 3Com to plead its case in the US, since "Palm" is an already established generic term that refers to small, handheld computers.<br><dd>Speaking of my favorite PDA, I've recently seen a number of news and opinion articles suggesting that the Pilot is the Macintosh of the upcoming PDA revolution. Unfortunately, it's true. There's little debate that pocket computing will be the first decade of the next century's equivalent of the personal computing revolution of the 1980's. Everyone, including Microsoft, is scrambling to get a piece of this new market now that the PC industry is collapsing under its low-low profit margins. The PalmPilot, currently the number one PDA, will suffer from fumbled marketing, bad naming, lack of new features, and shoddy licensing deals. 3Com has been playing it safe and enjoying the unparalleled success of the Palm line, but the WinCE for Palm PC's price/features mix will crush the Palm if these problems aren't fixed, lawsuits or not. Sounds like the Macintosh alrighty.<br><center><IMG width = 100% SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/don.gif"><br><hr width = 100%><br> <B>I'll Have What He's Been Drinking</B><p></center> <dd><I>"I can't imagine a technology that has been more underhyped."</I><br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top align = right> -Scott McNealy, Sun CEO,<br> referring to Java at the <br>JavaOne conference March 25<p></td></tr></table> <dd>Hmmm... sorry Scott, but the Donland hype-o-meter is reading off the scale on Java right now. I laughed out loud when I read the quote above. I mean, really. Companies are betting their entire future on Java. According to Larry Elison, Java-based NC's should have decimated Windows by now, and he had all sorts of developers and reporters following this. If that's not hype, I don't know what is. Java's always in the headlines- we're doing this with Java, Microsoft's doing that, we're saving the world with Java. Java, Java, Java! You can just hear Bill Gates screaming that like Jan Brady when Marsha gets all the attention.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
