Humbled by His insignificance before this vast, powerful land, Man is also elevated by it. Simply to dare to go into a treacherous canyon, to climb a sheer rock face, to go days at a time away from His fellows, to challenge His own mortality and the Universe itself. To stand alone before nature, defiant, and unbroken is to scream at the godhead, "I am here. Now. I am transitory and this land will outlive me, but I am here now, and I defy you!"<br><dd>So moved was the United States Congress that they agreed to create the first ever official wilderness. In so doing, by elevating the land and giving it a name, came a new breed. Tourists.<br><dd>As they flooded to the land, they brought with them their trash, the bottles, the TVs, Winabagos, and whiny kids more interested in their Gameboys. And eventually, the handicapped accessible game trails.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#223;</A></a>But the land, made to crush Man, was not exactly made accessible to the handicapped. As time passed, in went the paved paths, the gently sloping ramps, bleachers for audiences.<br> <dd>Guard rails.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/1.1.gif"><br><dd>As is the paradox of Man, what we love most, we destroy by our love. I first realized this at the age of 6 when the Hot Wheels I hated remained unchipped and new, while those I loved were aged and worn...until I took a hammer to the ones I didn't like. By placing that land above all others, we inadvertently led to its banality. Anyone can go there and look into Canyons carved over millions of years while eating popcorn and wearing "I saw Yellowstone" tee-shirts. The magic is gone, but the people, desperate to feel their insignificance and show their defiance, continue to come.<br><dd>Thus, I went to Yellowstone.<br><dd>There are still some small pockets of resistance, some outcroppings here and there of the once unspoiled land. It was to these places that my family and I ambulated toward with a maximal amount of friction between our pedacular coverings and the granulated mantle of the globe.<br> <dd>We were dragging our feet, guys. Come on. Keep up.<br><dd>At the start of our journey we were in the Bear Tooth Pass near Red Lodge. Planning to spend a week camping and hiking on some of the trails through that range, three successive days of excessive rain helped us decide to move on.  It seemed near impossible to dry everything out in the twenty precipitance free minutes a day. Besides, there are only so many ways of keeping yourself amused while remaining wet under a poncho and poncing along soggy Rocky Mountain trails.<br> <dd>We hadn't seen this much rain since our vacation a few years earlier with a family friend, who always seemed to pack away Rochester weather as one of her possessions (During that trip we had a tornado follow us up a one hundred and fifty mile stretch of highway and across a state line, it's amazing how acts of nature never really seem to heed interstate boundaries). Regions that normally receive only 3-4 inches of rainfall a year would be doused with twice its yearly ration of precipitation in her presence.<br> <dd>Nevertheless we decided to shove off towards Yellowstone a little early and perhaps catch up on the hiking and backpacking once we were there. So we loaded up our truck and set off across the Bear Tooth Pass and arrived in Yellowstone that same evening.<br> <dd>Dusk was already far behind us but we were lucky that we were able to find a camping spot for the night just inside Yellowstone. Forced to cook in the dark we were happy simply to be dry. The strange thing was that as we were brewing up our nightly culinary delight there seemed to be several rodents scurrying about under our feet.  My sister and I tried to figure out how many there were, but we would only see one at a time.  It was too dark to distinguish them well even with the Coleman lantern. Every time any of us started following their movements, those little, furry, grass-totting varmints would scurry beneath our truck and pull a David Copperfield without all the busty women in flowing, sexy gowns. Odd as it seemed, none of us decided to worry our pretty little heads over it, and the evening ended as we eventually all tottered off to our separate bunks.<br> <dd>After our first few nights we began to get ready to move further into Yellowstone. As my father and I were the only ones up at the start of Chipmunk, I was drafted for timing duty (Which aside from the fact that I got to hold a gun wasn't all that special, especially considering that all it shot was a strobe light.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#128;</A></a> Even so, it was better than spending the next three hours driving over the mountains, listening to the engine "ping").<br> <dd>I had taken up my position to the left side of the truck, aiming my gun intently on its target in the engine. Just having given my father the signal to start up the engine I suddenly noticed that there was a small pile of refuse littering the very top of the engine. This heap of grass, fuzzy stuff, and assorted debris had seemed to have arranged itself in a neat and orderly manner (Kids: Crop circles!) right between all eight spark plugs. As I started clearing some of the trash away I noticed that bits of it were moving under their own steam. In fact two very bleary-eyed bits were groggily trying to figure out what had just happened to their rather comfy homestead.<br><dd>"Stop the engine and get out here!" I yelled to my father. When he arrived at my side, I pointed to our little squatters.<br><dd>He looked at it, then at me a with a quizzical expression on his face."Well, what did you put that there for?"<br> <dd>I guess it wasn't entirely out of character for me to do something like that and he apparently had not seen our visitors who had by this time quite gotten a hold of their senses.<br><dd>Soon, the little buggers started scurrying back and forth across the engine in a dazed state. They had just been waking up from our loud disturbances, and oh yeah, half of their house was missing. Funny how those sort of freak accidents occur.<br> <dd>When my father finally saw our architectural stow-aways, we finished clearing their nest out of the engine, uprooting their entire night's work. But mice couldn't possibly live in some one's engine, especially not one that was going to burn as hot as our's would in the next few days. Eventually we saw their little light gray and light brown pelts wiggle off and away we went.<br><dd>During that day we drove close to a hundred miles up and over mountainous terrain to our next camping spot. The next morning, while doing the daily ritual of checking the timing, my family discovered that we still had undesired tenants.<br> <dd>This became commonplace as every morning we found our little guests had rebuilt their dream home after we tore it down. No matter how far we drove in a day and no matter what the terrain, every morning our guests would rebuild their nest. We figured out that when we drove during the day, they would move down to the wheel well for protection. Why not live in an engine? It provided an excellent home for two small creatures: it was warm and dry, excellent protection from natural predators, you got to see the world, and if you could put up with a little grease, there were full supplies of food in the back of the truck to sample of, even health food if they started getting fat off of the Lucky Charms&#153;.<br> <dd>We eventually asked some rangers for assistance and the one who got the trap for us confided that in fifteen years of working in Yellowstone, he had not seen the like of our little misadventure. We still cleared their nest every morning, and caught quick glimpses of them as they ran down to their traveling quarters. Their light fur became darker and more covered with grease, but they seemed happy enough.<br><dd>Finally we managed to drive them off. Thankfully, we got our chance to continue on our early efforts of hiking and backpacking, and were gone for three days. Little did we know that our hitch-hikers had gone into the wilds of Yellowstone and been accepted by the natives.<br><IMG align = left width = 50 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>In this land, time, as we in the West think of it, has little meaning. What does six o'clock in the morning mean to a tree? More importantly, what does six o'clock in the morning mean to a chipmunk? Beyond the machines that demand man to conform to their way, the animals are the best indicators of time. In a comparable landscape, there can be no other sort of reference and we must adapt to use this new chronology.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Take for example Chipmunk. Extending from six o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock in the afternoon,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#134;</A></a> these were the most devious of the Creature Day Time System (CDTS).<br> <dd>There were a crew of two working our neck of the woods. One of these insidious little creatures would get our attention-he would sit on a rock somewhere and act as friendly and cute as possible, speaking in a Spanish accent.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#181;</A></a> While our whole family would be caught up in the Ahhawwwing cycle ("Ahhawww, isn't he cute?") en mass, his furry sidekick would be chewing a hole through our industrial strength bear proof food bag.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#248;</A></a> If one of us hadn't gotten hungry and walked over to the bag to pull out breakfast, the little demons would have made off with all of our life sustaining grub. Luckily for us, we had caught them on the first morning, after which point, when any of those little furbags tried out their cute routine on us, we had one person on food patrol.<br><IMG align = right width = 100 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>As the chipmunks would pull back, the second time period would begin. Extending from ten o'clock until two thirty, flies would descend upon us: big ones, tall ones, short ones, small ones, basically any way Dr. Suess could think of to describe different flies.  That's what we were surrounded by on our hike, and oh yeah, they all would bite, even if they weren't really the right kind. House flies would somehow manage to draw blood...I think it was the principal of the whole matter. They must have been having little fly machismo contests.<br> <dd>Anyway, we suddenly found ourselves surrounded by flies in numbers reminiscent of the Amityville Horror, drilling their little fly bodies into the ground ("I will gauge out your compound eyes and skull fuck them"). The best I can say for these buggers is that at least they spread the wealth, so to speak. Each of us was attacked with the same fervor and blood lust as the next. It was equal opportunity pestilence, got to give a hand to the Rider for that, at least he never picked favorites....<br>  <dd>Of course there were mosquitoes. How could there not be mosquitoes? From 2:30 until 8:00pm they swarmed down on us, numbering in the thousands, and no amount of Deep Woods Off&#153; would ever deter these fighter pilots bent on the successful propagation (For every one drop of blood, one thousand mosquitoes are born. And every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings) of the species. We were still hiking and the only respite we found would be contained within the few speckles of sun light that filtered down between the trees every quarter mile or so; we got attacked by only half as many mosquitoes in the sunlight.<br><dd>My eldest sister and I ended up walking much faster than the rest of my family members, trying to outrun our attackers, I walked still faster than my sister. From behind me I would hear her voice say, "...right thigh, left calf, left shoulder, right forearm..." the words that would not cease. This was her message to me on where a mosquito was about to strike or so I thought.<br> <dd>I eventually went mad and ran a quarter of a mile to a place that was swathed in a bath of sunlight. When my sister finally caught up with me she confided in me the meaning of her secretive code, right thigh actually meant that I had about twenty mosquitoes priming their engines, not two or three as I had suspected. I was so covered with mosquito bites that you could have made a topographical map of my skin.<br> <dd>When the remainder of my family  caught up to us, I learned another rather disturbing fact. My family had apparently brought along a more potent mosquito repellent than the afore mentioned Deep Woods that I was not entirely privy to, it was called me. I may not smell like a pine forest, but just watch those buggers flee from anyone else's side to be near mine. I could count the number of bites my entire family had received on two hands. I was lucky though, in this part of the Rocky Mountains, the mosquitoes went to bed early, they were probably fleeing the approaching hordes of the next time....<br><dd>There are vast numbers of mice living in Yellowstone, more than imagined, and these nomadic, Fremen mice had taken in our two refugees. They were fearless, and why not? What did these mice have to fear? They had been taught the weirding way by Maud'Did, one of the two mice we had banished from our truck, and were coming back  to get all of our food.<br><dd>He who can destroy a thing controls a thing.<br><dd>The night we returned from our hiking, the Fremen mice attacked. They were like mousy of borg, working as one entity. I was given the task of guarding the food bag while my family fixed dinner and sat hunched over it chomping on my Fruit Roll-Up&#153; trying to watch every different angle at once.<br><dd>I couldn't see them, but I knew they were there. (I must not fear, fear is the mind killer) My proximity detector was going off and I was just waiting to hear, "Dallas, get out of there!" In the distance, a massive ball of light lit the night and I could hear one of my sister's saying, "They've blown the camp walls. They've blown the camp wa-." Amid a cloud of dust smelling of cinnamon I saw the mice riding their sand cats come through the gap. Helpless, they slowly closed their circle until they were close enough that I could reach out and poke them in the nose. In the fully gathered twilight, the eerie blue eyes of the mice shown as warning and I momentarily placed my fruit roll-up by my side to ward off my attackers.<br> <dd>Swinging my hand right into the face of one of my nemesi, he didn't flinch.<br> <dd>"I WILL kill YOU!" I cried.<br><dd>Next thing I knew, my fruit roll-up had sprouted stubby little legs and was speedily heading for the thicker spread of trees. How could this be? For he was the Kwisatz Haderach. Back up! I need back up now!<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>"Cover me!" I shouted to one of my sisters as I chased a fruit roll-up that seemed to hover an inch above the ground as it wove it's way through weed and dell.<br> <dd>The chase scene lasted about a minute, and I finally caught the wascally varmint. My reward: a fruit roll-up that had diminished in size by about half.<br> <dd>It was easy to see now why we could not deter them. They could take us any time they wanted. They were just toying with us. A couple hundred of them attacking all at once would reduce us all to a pile of bones in a portion of an hour. The sheer immensity of the challenge humbled us, but we stood our ground. We were going down, but we would defy this force of nature. We're still here!<br><dd>Suddenly, a force darker than the night yet brighter than the end of a roach came crashing through the underbrush.  Six feet tall, clad in ripped tie-dye and those pants that only recently came back into style with the advent of skaters, the Stoned Hippie of Yellowstone tore his way into the diorama of doom.<br> <dd>"Duuuuuude," he proclaimed, as twigs cascaded from his variegated dreads, "I (exhalation) HATE these things, man."  His spare tire wriggled erratically as he dug through pockets littered with seeds and empty Ziploc baggies.  Eyeing my fruit roll-up, he asked, "Hey, ya got any more of those? Or maybe some Twinkies or something?"<br><dd>I stood frozen; he appeared unaware of the imminent danger.  The fruit Roll-up had been only the beginning.  The Stoned Hippie of Yellowstone would only contribute to the blood bath I was sure would ensue.  After removing his wallet, attached by a long chain to his belt, he produced a small piece of black rubber.  He reached back into his army surplus frame pack and fished out a piece of surgical tubing, stained a curious deep brown.  After fitting what I now understood to be the mouthpiece to the tube, he drew deeply.  The backpack produced a strange, high-pitched "fweeeeeeeeeee," accompanied by low gurgling.  The mice withdrew, forming ranks that would put Pol Pot to shame.<br>  <dd>As I realized I had been saved by this evolutionary throwback, I became weak with relief.  The Stoned Hippie, mistaking my glazed expression for interest in his rig, explained "DUDE, the backpack bong, man.  This will be in every home in twenty years. I'm the next Gates, hah hah hah." With that, he trundled off into the woods, "fweeeeing" as the mice trailed behind.<br><dd>Safe for the time being, we made our food bag as mouse-proof as possible and prayed the Stoned Hippie would leave us some food after he satisfied his munchies. Sleeping in our tents, we could hear the pitter-patter of hundreds of tiny little feet, and the distant "fweeeing" of his battle with the mice.<br><dd>Chipmunk came, and we heard the last of the stragglers making their way off to bed. Our hippie proofing had worked (we liberally applied ground up copies of the Wall Street Journal) and we had a breakfast to wake up to. But they'd be back, oh yes, they'd all be back. Meanwhile, we had some cute chipmunks to deal with.<br>  </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#223;</A> Imagine if you will, polio stricken FDR snugly wrapped in his blanket perched on the edge of an enchanting mountain vista.

Unfortunately for the decrepit president, he forgot to pull his parking brake.

Morning's like, what, 12 o'clock to twelve o'clock? That's too long! Night doesn't start until after 5 o'clock. I think morning is getting way too much time. We've got 24 hours, we should break it up into 8 hour increments and give morning the C shift: 2am to 10am. Afternoon would be 10am to 6pm and night would be 6pm to 2am. There'd have to be union coffee breaks, of course, but isn't that a nice system. It's unfortunate that 10am would be called afternoon, but with some retraining camps I think people will get over it. Or just start calling it Mid-Day and referring to people as Goodman and Goody. That might be going too far, though." Thanks, Kelly. Meanwhile, back in the article...<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#181;</A> Kelly swears that the chipmunks did indeed speak with Spanish accents although she refuses to commit on whether they were Spanish accents or perhaps a little more Puerto Rican sounding.
