For our final installment, we will each give our own response to Radiohead and Spiritualized's show in Toronto on Easter Sunday. You can still contact us, but we will not be writing again until next fall.</I><p><B>Mike's opinions:</B><br><dd>On Easter Sunday, April 12, Radiohead played in Toronto and Justine and I were there. Radiohead's <I>OK Computer</I> has been proclaimed the greatest album of all time in England's <I>Q Magazine</I>. They were also at the top of nearly every list, including here in the US.<br><dd>In <I>Rolling Stone</I>, and <I>SPIN</I> the album has been labeled <I>The Dark Side Of The Moon </I>for the 1990s.<br><dd>Their shows are nearly impossible to get tickets to, as they sell out arenas and stadiums in mere minutes. Their recorded sound is textured, impulsive, cultured and-as many fans, critics, and journalists report- "virtually impossible to translate into a live setting." But they do it, seemingly effortlessly.<br><dd>Opening for the show was England's Spiritualized, whose album <I>Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space</I> is taking England by storm. On the album, their sound is one of ambient, electro/space rock with just a little but of the Beatles thrown in (as seen in their song "Come Together"). Their show was quite different.<br><dd>They were just as spacey as their album, but included less techno and had more power chords (at some points they would play one chord for almost five minutes, yet it would constantly increase in energy until it reached a feverish state). Their set lasted about an hour.<br><dd>Then, in a surprisingly short time, Radiohead came on to many thousands of screaming fans. They opened with <I>OK Computer's</I> "Airbag." At this point, I understood that Radiohead live was a far greater of experience than listening to the album. They proceeded to play most of <I>OK Computer</I> and their previous album, <I>The Bends</I>.  (They only played one song off of their first album, <I>Pablo Honey</I>, and it wasn't `Creep.') Their set was fantastic. Every song was spirited, loud, and virtually flawless.<br><dd>The lighting effects need to be commended: of all of the shows I have ever seen, the stage lighting was by far the most exciting.  The lighting used the lyrics and moods of the songs effectively to create symbolism (red and white lights were used for the song "The Bends," the title track from their second album which featured a red and white album cover).<br><dd>Another highlight was when Thom Yorke (pronounced "Tom York"), the lead singer, began to sing "Talk Show Host" (which appeared on the <I>Romeo and Juliet</I> soundtrack). The band began to play, and all of a sudden, Thom yelled, "Stop!"<br><dd>The audience was confused. After a few seconds the song started again, and Thom began to sing. A few lines in, he started swearing and the band stopped again. At this point, the audience was completely bewildered. An embarrassed Thom asked the audience, "What are the words?"<br><dd>The audience cheered wildly (half laughing, half shouting out lyrics). The band started playing again and Thom struggled through the lyrics. During the song's instrumental bridge, Thom went wild at his guitar, turning the laid-back tune into a raucous, violent, angry epic. He was obviously quite pissed off. This bridge proceeded to overcome the rest of the song, as it went on for several minutes until Thom (I assume) calmed down.<br><dd>Another highlight was during the encore, when the band played, as Thom put it, "a new one." This was (obviously), a track that had not yet been (and may not ever be) recorded. The song was very similar to "Fake Plastic Trees" in that it was acoustic and melodic.<br><dd>Every song that the group performed was incredible and breathtaking: "Airbag," "Paranoid Android," "The Bends," "Bulletproof," "Street Spirit," "Fake Plastic Trees," and virtually every other song from the most recent two albums (strangely, "High And Dry," one of the singles from <I>The Bends</I>, and "Electioneering," from <I>OK Computer</I>, were absent).<br><dd>In all, anyone who has a chance to see Radiohead should do anything in their power to do so. Their show is nothing short of incredible.<br><center>-Mike</center><p><B>Justine's opinions:</B><br><dd>I have loved Radiohead's <I>OK Computer</I> since I managed to get a copy of it last summer. Luckily, I was one of the fortunate to see Radiohead and Spiritualized play in Toronto. The show was held at the Maple Leaf Gardens, otherwise known as the hockey arena. The acoustics were better than I expected since hockey is normally handled in there.<br><dd>Spiritualized played a series of long jams that were psychedelic jazz tinged with vocals sometimes thrown in. they carried it off better than I expected. I could not envision how their most recent album,<I> Ladies And Gentleman, We Are Floating In Space</I> could be performed in the first place. It is very electronic and spacey.<br><dd>Radiohead drew most of their material from their last two albums, <I>OK Computer</I>, and <I>The Bends</I>. They create a grand sound. Their sound, their songs, and their entire show was of epic proportions.<br><dd>We might have had terrible, nose bleed seats, but this all becomes irrelevant when they continue to play. It is a lovely rapture.<br><dd>Time is suspended.<br><dd>Thom, the lead singer can do no wrong, even when forgetting the lyrics to "Talk Show Host."  This just added to his charm and made the song even better as he preceded to remember and get very upset with himself, launching into a very energetic guitar solo-of sorts.<br><dd>After doing one encore, the band was exhausted, returning into the night. If only you could have been there: it was an event, an experience, a transportation, and a dream of higher elements.  Just think, we were on the same continent, in the same city, and at the same venue; I feel so very fortunate to have had the experience of Radiohead.<br><center>-Justine<p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white>plugg&#233;d is(?) a weekly music column focusing on the newest releases, providing accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information, coupled with informative and informed opinions.
