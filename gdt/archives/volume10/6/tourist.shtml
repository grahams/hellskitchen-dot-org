Suck.<br><dd>Suck.  Oh my God, that really sucked.  Jesus!  There is nothing I've seen in a long while that has sucked as much.  That really sucks.  Wanna know why?  I am partly responsible.  I apologize.  For all of you who paid to see the latest installment of the  "Natasha Henstridge's Breasts Show", my condolences.  I worked on the set of the film.  They shot it last summer a few miles away from my home, and I had the pleasure of helping out as a lowly production assistant - 18 hour days, no pay, no respect.  It was damn fun though.  I was on the swing gang, or "spooge crew" as we were affectionately refereed to by the others on the set.<br><center><table align = center><tr><td valign = top><IMG width = 75% SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images6/tourist.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><font size = +1><center><B>Natasha getting bent</B></center><br></font size></td></tr></table><br></center>  <dd>Basically, our job was to spread various colors of this creamy, viscous, and messy as all hell liquid all over these large cocoons that were in a barn (for those of you who haven't seen the film, there are about 25 cocoons, and they all needed tender loving spooge attention).  We goop'd all day long, then spent the rest of the day operating the tentacles in the cocoons with specially designed manifolds (operated by Sears wet/dry shop-vacuums).  All in all, the experience was well worth the sweat and tears, not to mention that asshole effects coordinator who kept breathing down our necks because we weren't realizing his vision correctly.  "Get Bent" we (production assistants) said.  "We're not getting paid to do any of this shit, and we're certainly not getting paid to put up with yours!"  He mumbled something about "fucking east coast..." and wandered off to check the lacerating tongue effects on the SIL costume.  Lunch was pretty cool.  I expected PB&J, but instead was treated to boiled lobster and fettuccini.  Wow.  Catering rules.  All you can eat gourmet.  Hollywood realizes that a fed crew is a happy crew.  Between large meals, you can snack on the set at the Craft Service tent (which is really a shed, but they call it a tent to make it sound more important or something).  They have all kinds of munchies there, from Snickers bars to frozen yogurt.  I was looking for some Slim Jims, when a leggy blonde entered the shed.<br>  <dd>"What are you looking for?" Natasha asked.<br><dd>"I've seen you naked," my mind reeled.  Quickly trying to cover for the wanton look in my eyes, I replied.<br><dd>"Slim Jim's?"<br><dd>"Well, I don't see them, but If I do, I'll bring them out to you," she said.<br><dd>"Can you make those tentacles shoot out of your boobs?" I was dying to ask.  But I settled for the standard dumbfounded male response to female celebrity cordiality.<br><dd>"Thanks," I smiled.<br><dd>Leaving the set that day was wonderfully relaxing.  I had made new superficial friends.  I had eaten lobster.  I had worked with the guy who played the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man (Bill Bryan of XFX).  But more importantly, I had said three words to a fine actress who has no doubt provided adolescent males around the world with quality masturbation material for several years now.<br>  <dd>Nobody rents "Species" for the plot.  Come on.  The end looks like the alien was animated by Disney, or those assholes who churned out episodes of Babylon 5, Earth 2, and Sea QuestDSV on their workhorse Video Toasters (not that I'm knocking the toaster at all, but just because you can, doesn't mean you SHOULD).  From working in a video store for three years, you pick up on the demographic for "Species" and the like.  It's usually that, and "Embrace of the Vampire", which is another terrible film, but it features Alyssa Milano from "Who's the Boss" topless for a generous portion of screen time.<br>  <dd>Anyway, when I finally went to see the final product, the sequel to end all sequels, I was dismayed.  The clich&eacute; counter was going off the scale.  Angry Generals...DING!  Evil Politicians...DING!  Token Black guy for comedic relief...DING!  Troubled and reluctant scientist...DING!  Lines like "You want me to come back?  The last time, that thing almost killed me"...DING!  Altruistic suicidal "Good" alien saves her human friends... DING!  My god.  Suck.  Suck.  Suck.  Suck.  I'm sorry.<br>  <dd>If, however, you do make it to the film, remember that there's a bit of ole' Tourist in the slimy goodness.  Sometimes I wish I could take it back, dammit.  Oh well. You'll still see some boobs though.  Thumbs up.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
