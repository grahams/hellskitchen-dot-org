It certainly sounds...fun doesn't it? Maybe you should ask the bonobo chimpanzee about this. The bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimp, lives in the humid forests of Zaire, just south of the Zaire River. Instead of displaying outright anger and hurting one another in the group, they settle disputes with sex.<br> <dd>How cool is that? Think about it: you're driving your friend home from school. He wants to listen to a radio station, but you are quite content with the one you are listening to. Each of you start the button battle on the radio and it starts getting ugly, a classic fight. Eventually one of you gets really aggressive and hurts the other. At this point you both realize that you won't get anything accomplished, so the obvious approach is to enjoy a nice sloppy compensation of road head.<br> <dd>In the bonobo world, disputes are settled much like the hypothetical situation above. Basically, it all comes down to "I'll give you a kiss, if you give me a banana." This keeps the group from excessive fighting or getting too aggressive with each other and hurting other bonobos in the group.<br> <dd>At this point you might say to yourself, "Wow! These bonobos fuck like rabbits. I think I'd like to be reincarnated as a bonobo." Well, that's great if you aren't getting any right now, but let's look at their society. Unlike our society, an egalitarian society, most of the other chimpanzees are patriarchal. The bonobos, however, live under a matriarchal society. For those who don't understand, it's the woman in the family who wears the pants.<br><center><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images7/monkeyfuck.gif"><br></center> <dd>Hmm, that's pretty interesting. For all you macho guys out there who can't handle a woman being on top, I guess the bonobo life isn't for you. What's even more interesting is that bonobos are classified as the closest link to humans. Does this mean that our society will evolve to a matriarchal society? Who knows, but I do like the prospect of having my women on top.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/gb.html">Gad Berger</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
