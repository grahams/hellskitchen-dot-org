Much to her credit, Kari's machine ran flawlessly on its second try, but still we have become accustomed to pathetic interest in our contests.<br> <dd>While keeping this in mind, we thought that no one would be crazy enough to decode our uu-encoded sound file for a mere t-shirt. Well, as so often occurs we were quite mistaken. One entry for a two hundred dollar prize and multiple entries for a ten dollar t-shirt, go figure.

Not quite worth a t-shirt, but I give up. Can I maybe get a nice GDT sock?<br><dd>- Jeremiah<p>07:09:23<p><dd>I'm not sure, but it sounds like Huckleberry Hound saying "I'm a bear."<br><dd>Other possibilities include "yoga fire", "build a fire", "I'm a pirate", "over there", and "I'm retired".<br><dd>- Jeremiah<p>07:09:32<p><dd>Did I already guess "I'm On Fire?"<br><dd>- Jeremiah<p>07:09:37<p><dd>Okay, I've decided. It -is- a chipmunk mumbling "I'm a bear". I can't be too certain, because the OCR didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but that's my guess.<br><dd>- Jeremiah<p>11:14:21<p>I'm fairly sure that Hell's Kitchen kindly forwarded my entry, but just in case, it uudecodes to (and I could be wrong here), "I'm a bear".<br><dd>- Jeremiah<p></multicol><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><hr width=100% align=left><br><font size = +1><dd>You guessed it, the chipmunk was mumbling, "I'm a bear!"<br><dd>Congratulations Jeremiah!<br><dd>As is customary with our contest winners, we invite you to spend a fun filled afternoon with our staff as we produce yet another issue and become entangled in a caffeine induced euphoria while sipping Cafe Diablo, a tightly guarded secret known only to the Kitchen staff.<br><dd>-a very dead Kelly Gunter<br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter </A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
