For better or for worse, this probably comes more from the misconceptions of what GDT is than it does from our inability to make any sense. Probably.<br><dd>Simply because we are in the shape of a magazine doesn't mean that we set out to be like one. Quite to the contrary, GDT is meant to be an on-going saga for the dedicated reader. Unlike a magazine which produces separate and unrelated features each issue, GDT strives to intricately tie itself into its past. We want people to think of us as a friend with whom they have shared many jokes, stories, and good times. Every so often we'll throw in a, "Remember when..." comment in the hopes that people will think back and get a chuckle from our unexpected tangent to an old piece.<br><dd>As early as our second issue (12 March 1995), we felt the need to explain some terms that the three founders of the groups used amongst themselves to quickly convey information. Since then, we've told readers each week what we were thinking about, what frightened us, and reminisced about a past that we hope they have shared with us at some point.<br><dd>Take this week's issue (Volume 10, issue 7, April 29 1998) for example. The footnote, "You need to capitalize God because He thinks He's an ethnic group," though silly on its own, is actually a mention to an issue we printed in the fall called "O' Canada" (Volume 8, issue 2, September 14 1997) where we mentioned the balkanization of countries based on ethnic differences. Looking for someone to blame the general ethnic unrest in the world on, we fingered the Pandora Group, which was first talked about in "Universe" (Volume 4 issue 8 May 5 1996) as the group responsible for covering up the archeological discoveries of fossilized squirrels found with flashlights shoved into their mouths. When discussing time traveling squirrels, the concept of non-linear time and multiple realities cropped up, tying it back to "Incest" (Volume 3, issue 7 February 4 1996), where we attempted to give helpful advice to people on how they could be their own nephew by blood relation. Turns out that the facilities of the Cronus Corp, a subsidiary of Hell Inc., were the only way one could convince one's father to impregnate his daughter prior to one's birth. Hell Inc. and its multifaceted subsidiaries is mentioned in dozens of issues, but first made its appearance in "Ethiopian-Flypaper-Boy" (Volume 1, issue 1 February 19 1995).<br><dd>James Burke would be proud.<br><dd>So, the next time you run into a footnote or a seemingly off-the-wall comment in GDT that you think has nothing to do with anything, remember that it's probably a tip of the hat to our past and a little extra for our dedicated friends who have read us for years and for those to come, who will.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond </A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
