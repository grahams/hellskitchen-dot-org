I was walking around the second floor, minding my own business, bothering no one.  No one that is, except Barry, President Simone's right hand man.  I never actually said anything to him, he was bothered simply by the fact that I was there.<br> <dd>When he saw me, he walked over to a parking officer.  He said something to the officers and I saw the officer look over at me.  He then turned on his walkie-talkie and spoke into it.  About a minute later, I was asked to step outside by a Campus Safety officer.  I asked her why, only to be told that I had just better step outside.<br>   <dd>She did not really know what was going on, so she called her supervisor.  Ten minutes later, when he showed up, I told him that I had not done anything and asked why I was being detained.  He agreed that as an RIT student, I did have the right to be in an RIT academic building, but he wanted to get both sides of the story.  He went inside to talk to Barry.<br> <dd>By the time he came out, two other officers joined him.  They told me that I was not allowed in the building.  I asked them why.  They said that I would disrupt the Board of Trustees meeting.  I told them that I had no intention of doing that. I am not aware of any rule against that.<br> <dd>So, I walked into the building.  I was told by campus safety officers not to go on the second floor and was followed by one of the officers throughout the first floor.  After 5 minutes or so, the Campus Safety officer lost me and went on the second floor.<br> <dd>I informed one of the officers on the second floor that I needed to go speak to John Klofas, the head of the Criminal Justice Department about an event the RCC wants to put on in the beginning of next year. He was upstairs at the Liberal Arts display that was set up for the trustees. "Not today" was the officer's reply.<br> <dd>I walked up the stairs and out into the balcony area of the second floor, overlooking the entrance and main lobby.  I spotted one Campus Safety officer far down the hall and he saw me. I calmly walked towards him, got a drink of water, and then walked back the balcony area.  I leaned against the railing and read <I>The Reporter</I>.<br> <dd>Campus Safety officers soon surrounded me.  They told me that I had to leave the building.  I disagreed, pointing out that I had done nothing wrong.  They ignored me.  One started using his body to push me towards the stairs in an effort to get me to leave the building.  By this time, there were 5 officers around me.  They said that I was causing a disturbance.  I replied that I was being quiet and peaceful and that it was they who were causing the disturbance.   I asked them if I was under arrest and told them that if I was, they should put handcuffs on me, read me my rights, and I would leave.  They continued to push me.<br>   <dd>One of the officers said something to the others and they started grabbing me.  I asked if I was under arrest, to which they did not reply. They wrestled me to the ground and pinned me down. I had five officers on top of me.  They put the handcuffs on my left hand first. I informed them that I had broken my left arm badly a few years ago and that the handcuff was hurting my wrist.  Soon I was handcuffed under the weight of five officers.  In the time they had me on the ground, my knee got knocked around a bit.  I went to the emergency room later on that night to get it checked out.<br> <dd>They lifted me up and started to drag me out of the building through the back entrance.  They brought me outside, sat me down on the curb, and brought me to the Campus Safety office in a Student Government van.<br> <dd>On the way to the Campus Safety office, I asked if I was being arrested.  One of the officers said that I was and that he was also going to try to arrange to have me kicked out of school.<br> <dd>I met with a person from the Judicial Affairs department.  She handed me a letter that said that Campus Safety had reported to her that I had disrupted a Board of Trustees meeting and that I was under the influence of alcohol.  Both were blatant lies.  Campus Safety knew that I had not disrupted any meeting.  And as far as the charge that I was under the influence of alcohol, I can only speculate. I believe that they lied to the Judicial Affairs department so that I would be suspended from school.  I was told that I was not allowed on the RIT campus, including my apartment at Perkins.  I will be arrested for trespassing if I am found on campus.<br>     <dd>I have been cast out of RIT life.  Luckily, I have some good friends who have been kind enough to let me sleep on their couch.  I left campus with $6 in my wallet and no way to use the debit I ordinarily use for one or two meals a day.  I did some gardening for a friend to earn some Ramen noodle and Chicken and Stars soup.<br> <dd>I have missed two very important classes so far, and before my judicial hearing, I will end up missing seven more.  I have not been able to use school facilities to do work for these classes.  I missed my indoor soccer team's playoff game on Sunday.  I am paying rent for an apartment that I am not allowed into.<br> <dd>You never really appreciate your home until it is taken away.  The hardest thing about this whole situation is not being able to go to my apartment.  Before this incident, I took my bed and my shower for granted. Campus Safety never gave any reason why I was not allowed in the building. Yet this did not stop them from physically pushing me to the ground, throwing handcuffs on me, and then dragging me to their offices.  Once there, I had my backpack searched and my wallet and keys taken from me.<br>   <dd>I am being charged with two counts of disorderly conduct by the Henrietta Police Department.  Once again, Campus Safety lied, telling the Henrietta officer that I had disrupted the Board of Trustees meeting. Campus Safety wanted me to be arraigned and put in jail for the night. The Henrietta officer talked them out of that.<br>   <dd>The school is charging me with five violations of the RIT Conduct Code.  I face suspension from school and the loss of this quarter's credits.  My judicial hearing is scheduled for Thursday at 11am.<br> <dd>All of this because I was in an RIT building.<p>  <center>	-Shea Gunther</center><p><center><table valign = center align = center border><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000 align = center><font color = white><B><font size = +1><center>Let us hear your voice.<br> Send mail to<br><gdt@iname.com> or <br>GDT/472 French<br> Road/Rochester, NY/14618<br></font color></font size></B><br></td></tr></table></center></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
