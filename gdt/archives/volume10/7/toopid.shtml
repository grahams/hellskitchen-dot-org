He evidently had forgotten that the screen door even existed and blundered his way into it, ripping it from the edges and bending the lightweight metal. Warped and under stress it wasn't designed for, the screen leapt from the sliding glass door frame like a spring with a satisfying "PWOANNNGGGG!" landing unceremoniously ten meters<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> away and sending a large cloud of dust into the stagnant early afternoon air. After a moment of disorientation, the screen killer, with a voice more like the low growl of a creature on the island of Dr. Moreau-a growl that rippled through one's ears and caused images of banjos and unitooths to flit through one's subconscious-says, "I'm sorry, he can't come out to play. He says He won't come out until you decide to play fair. You've got to tell Athena and the Lady to go home first."<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images7/1.1.gif"><br><dd>In the second floor window of what, for lack of a better word, is the house from which the behemoth of a man emerged, an aged and sun stained shade shifted and for the briefest of moments, He could be seen peering out with a troubled look on His once proud face.<br> <dd>In a fit of contrariness, the petitioner raised his fists to the heavens and whatever personifications still dared to abide within them and vociferated, "Evolution! You can't hide in there forever! You'll have to come out sometime."<br><dd>"Yes," He replied at a near whisper, "but by that time you will all have died." Slowly He withdrew from the window, deeper into the semi-darkness of the room to wait. Patience was something He had plenty of, for He'd caught Her eons ago with Her guard down. After years of drying, pulverizing, and bottling, there was more than enough of Her to wait out Mankind's cleverness. He sometimes thought He could even out wait the Lady's fascination with these strangely intelligent idiot bipeds, but He never allowed Himself to fully contemplate the idea, lest the Lady find out and spite Him for all time....<br><dd>Evolution is no longer in action, His role of ultimately forcing the world to make sense and be as one with the Gods of Enthalpy in a sea of Entropy has been usurped under the guise of equal opportunities for unequal people. Despite the noble sentiment that we're all brothers, it's fairly clear that we are not all created equal. In a just society, everyone is equal under the law and should be given the same opportunities (the operative word being equal. No special benefits anywhere. Yes, I know the argument behind affirmative action, but forcing businesses to meet their quota of blacks is demeaning. Forcing bigots to hire people they don't like won't help remove racism. Re-education camps and furnaces for the helpless cases maybe, but not affirmative action). But when knives need little labels saying "Caution. May be sharp" in order to ensure that the playing field is level for all people to understand how knifes operate, then something's wrong with the game.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images7/1.2.gif"><br><dd>There was a time, not so long ago, when a man who decided to pick up his child and lift the cute tot over his head, as though supplicant to the Gods,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> into the inviting, spiraling arms of a ceiling fan would not have been allotted a large cash settlement from the company for its failure to place a warning sticker on the fan saying "Warning, sticking children's heads into moving blades is not nice and may result in toddler dismemberment. Do not sharpen blades," and would probably have been stoned or squashed underneath the middle school's censored book collection.<br><dd>Today, however, it is expected that the stupid and the careless should come out ahead. Buy a cup of hot coffee and spill it on your crotch. Oh, boy, oh boy! You can sue for an ungodly amount of money. Fall off a ladder cause you placed it on loose gravel? Eat a moldy chicken finger? Bathe your gremlin squeaky clean (bright light! bright light!)? It's not your fault, and there are millions in cash prizes awaiting you.<br><dd>Of course, the statement "stupid people shouldn't breed" is funny and may have some merit, but as my mother always said, "The world needs it's politicians and sanitation engineers." Besides, the truly stupid people don't do things that end up endangering themselves. They tend to live out quiet, banjo filled lives...at least until their single tooth falls out and they can't chew their only source of carbon: Slim-Jims&#153;; they just gum it. If you gum a Slim-Jim long enough, it disintegrates into thick, gelatinous bolus...and gives you mouth cancer.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>No, it is not the stupid people. It's the moderately intelligent ones and the ignorant. Case in point: when I was 11 I learned, quite by accident, of the Miller Urey Experiment. Biologists can skip to the next paragraph while I explain. Miller was one of those crazy scientists who believe that life EVOLVED, and set up an experiment to test whether the hypothetical conditions on earth several billion years ago could give rise to organic compounds. To make a very interesting experiment short and dry, he filled a big jar with various gasses and water, hooked it up to some electricity to simulate lightning and let it loose. Several days later he cracked that bad boy open and found adenine, one of the most common biological components and one of the bases of DNA, had been formed.<br><dd>Cool, I thought to myself. Armed with the various parts left over from years of tinkering with electrical equipment, I set about to build my own. Of course I had no way to test for organic compounds, but it sounded like a cool thing to do. It was better than trying to make friends.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images7/1.3.gif"><br><dd>So after a few days I'd done it. Two Sprite&#153; bottles attached to one another by the stems, a copper hose running from the top to the bottom and wrapped in fish tank hosing to act as a condenser. To simulate lightning, I had inserted two knitting needles through the sides, but with a modification: one was actually in the water at the bottom while the other was a few inches above. As for an atmosphere, I couldn't really simulate an ammonia rich sky, buy I did my best by mixing vinegar and baking soda and letting the heavier CO2 flow into the bottles prior to sealing it all up with epoxy and tar. That done, I filled an old crock pot with water to act as a water bath, suspended the assembly in the water, and began heating.<br><dd>The moment of truth came, and I attached what was left of an old fluorescent light to the needles. Wonders of wonders! It worked. Little sparks leapt from the needles and the water was starting to simmer. Knowing my parents would never approve, I moved everything into the basement where it ran for a few more days.<br> <dd>Finally, I wandered down to see if everything was still working and saw much to my dismay that the needles were no longer sparking. Acting as a sacrificial anode, the needle in the water had already disintegrated, leaving only a jagged piece of metal just above the surface of the water.<br><dd>"Well that's easy enough to fix," I said and slightly tipped the apparatus so the needle contacted the water once more....<br><dd>Now, as far as I can guess, in the course of several days, the electricity had been splitting the water into molecular hydrogen and oxygen (At some level I knew what should have happened, but hadn't thought the experiment through). So there I was, mucking around with a sealed vessel containing hydrogen, oxygen, and electricity.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images7/1.4.gif"><br><dd>As soon as the water hit the needle, there was a spark and I saw the most amazing thing in my life. Descriptions of Saint Elmo's fire had always fascinated me, but I'd never seen anything like it until then. A sky blue light emanated from the needle and fluidly moved away as though it had a mission. It crawled up the sides of the vessels, rolling back on itself and constantly changing shape. By this time I'd taken a step back, but couldn't tear my eyes off of what was happening.<br> <dd>When the cerulean blue cloud reached the top chamber, it suddenly grew larger, as though angry at not finding a way to escape. It turned from blue to orange and the entire apparatus suddenly compressed from the vacuum created inside. After a moment of stillness that seemed to last for eternity, the entire apparatus exploded, sending bits of plastic, wires, and tubing flying in fractured arcs across the cellar and dousing me with oddly smelling water.<br> <dd>"Holy shit," I said, awestruck and dripping in what had been my primordial sea.<br><dd>The point? Well, I was smart enough to cobble the damn thing together, but failed to think about what the consequences of such an experiment would be. Then again, my life has been filled with events like that.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#181;</A></a> The time I burned my eyebrows off trying to build a steam engine, the time I burned my leg hair off when my homemade cannon misfired, the time I burned my...well, you don't really want to hear about that. Evolution should have come for me with his sickle long ago, but I'm still here. Why? Mainly Luck. She's fickle, but ever since I told her the joke about the Jew, the Protestant, and the corn cob. <A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#223;</A></a> She's helped me out now and then. But more importantly, I'm alive simply because of the level of sophistication we've achieved.<br><dd>Let's say that when my Miller Urey Experiment exploded, the copper tube had gone through my skull and given me a lobotomy (Kids: Phineas Gage!). 100 years ago I would have been a very dead little boy, but today, I would have been rushed to the hospital where doctors would have worked over me until I was a very healthy emotionally crippled little boy (Kids: Phineas Gage!). Maybe doctors should have, in addition to all the insurance paperwork, a questionnaire finding out if you were hurt by someone else (good), an act of God (better), or if it was your own damn fault (sorry, no dice. Please go bleed somewhere else. What were you thinking? Trying to make a parachute out of trash bags....)<br><dd>It has been said that Luck favors the stupid (see above mention of the corn joke) and a thorough investigation into the past of Mankind, which would take all of a couple of minutes, should unearth enough evidence to prove the theory sufficiently (all stories of the dodo aside). The manifestation of Luck has so conspired, in the recent past, to unbalance the ratio of stupid people, that the manifestation of Evolution has been out sourced and gone home to live with His parents to whine.<br><dd>As long as we're clever and lucky, we've got Evolution beat. He can't get us directly. Sure, He's trying to sneak around us by making bacteria and viruses become resistant to all our very clever medicines, but He can't get us just yet. We're the smartest idiots He's ever come up against. He's got Time on His side, so don't be surprised when he shows up one day with a six-pack and says, "Have a soda. It's full of aluminum goodness.  Hey, we're missing ABC's TGIF line-up!"<br><dd>Will we recognize this long lost acquaintance after so many years?  Will we invite Him into our homes to eat our microwaved dinners, watch our TV and play Mah-Jong with our DNA?  Or will we see Evolution as the bum He is, whose occupation we've replaced as easily as the elevator operator?<br>   </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; Jimmy Carter would be proud.
