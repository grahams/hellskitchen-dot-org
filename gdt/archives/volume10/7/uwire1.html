Daddy's newest album is basically a posh little primer of what '40s swing can sound like if it's played by eight pinstriped guys during the turn of the millennium: DDD-crystalline, clean-cut and sexy -- and terse enough for radio play. And fun, baby -- slick-assed, swingin', big-band-lite fun.<br><dd>It's about damn time. If the '90s pop cultural conundrum of post-grunge, post-modernism, post-Me Generation has taught us anything, it's that having fun isn't supposed to come without a price: "If you're smiling, you're missing something."<br><dd>Sure, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy plays music that was cutting-edge cool 50 years ago. Sure, they're at the forefront of a scene that was co-opted from a '40s scene that was co-opted from urban African-American juke joints. And they don't truly do anything new with the music, except maybe play it impressively tight and record it better than any first- generation swing band ever could have.<br><dd>On the other hand, deconstructing Big Bad Voodoo Daddy like this just isn't fair to the band unless you're a jazz purist or scholar. For those of us who are neither, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is really about how much fun you're having, on or off the dance floor.<br><dd>"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" is imagery music from the get-go, establishing a nightclub mood and scenery in the first five seconds of "The Boogie Bumper" with the clink of martini glasses and early- evening lounge chatter. And its this sort of party where one really should be listening to music like this, if you weren't plopped in front of your stereo. It's also (presumably) a tribute to Hollywood's Derby club, where Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was established and a healthy portion of the swing revival began.<br><dd>Thematically, the songs of "Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" are straightforward, simplistic and, at first impression, nonpolitical. Chances are you'll never hear a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy cover of the Clash's "Guns of Brixton." That's cool -- there are plenty of other bands working at one edge or another of this genre that will take care of politics.<br><dd>And Big Bad Voodoo Daddy does just fine singing cut-up songs about being frustrated in love ("Maddest Kind of Love"), alcohol-induced love ("You & Me & the Bottle Makes 3 Tonight (Baby)"), giddily stupid love ("Jump with My Baby"), and sleazing through a nightclub with a highball's worth of swank attitude (take your pick).<br><dd>Half a century's worth of hindsight serves them well, too: The world has had years to metabolize Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway (Daddy does "Minnie the Moocher"). Even the greenest swing neophyte should instantly recognize Miller's "In the Mood" popping up like a revitalized ghost on the album's first track, "The Boogie Bumper."<br><dd>Scattering references to Miller and Benny Goodman ("Swing, Swing, Swing" is mimicked on "Jumpin' Jack") works a bit like a musical road map, but it's a potential problem, actually. The band has a niggling habit of repeating classic swing themes over and over again, without trying too hard to shake the dust from them.<br><dd>Lead singer Scotty Morris' velvety voice could stand a bit of abuse -- he never really cuts loose, even when his band does -- and stretching a few more songs past the three-and-a-half minute mark could make room for some much-needed jazzery (c'mon, guys -- FM hasn't picked up on the swing revival quite yet).<br><dd>Maybe next time. "Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" really isn't anything more than an updated swing primer, succinct and jittery; if that's the aim, the band's succeeded. And hey: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has given all you jet-set lounge lizards another musical excuse to break out your fedoras and bright red lipstick. Yeah, baby.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
