The advertisement appeared on <I>Reporter's</I> back cover and featured the RIT Tiger with the SG logo and a Tiger Oscar.  The insult, including such wise-ass remarks as "Peachy Keen!" and "W-O-W is about all I can say," appeared in the same issue under the Tab Ads on the pages immediately preceding the ad.<br><dd>Most ironic of all is that in the previous installment of the <I>Reporter</I> (April 24) the problem of apathy and indifference towards the Student Government was the subject of the editorial.<br><dd>"I guess they hit that one right on the money," said Slick, cartoon ferret and former employee of the <I>Reporter</I>.  "But I never foresaw that the problem could come from the staff itself.  There's such a fine line between making your own news and shooting yourself in the foot."<br><dd>Slick now works for <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> and, in an unprecedented turn of events, says that the <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> staff is offering a design and layout job to the Student government ad designer.<br><dd>"They're serious about it.  I strongly recommend that this designer, whoever he or she is, take the job.  It's great over here.  Not only do I not get insulted, but the Bare-Foot-Girl feeds me nummy grapes, and I don't have to worry about the staff members losing any of my and Perky's original comic strips.  And when Perky and I give them a strip it's guaranteed that it won't be tampered with or drawn on in any way, like the nipples that mysteriously appeared on our dancers in the 'Pringle's' strip.  How about that?"<br><dd>Perky, "a plainclothes art realie" with a "less than frequent sense of layout and design" could not be reached for comment.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/gm.html">Gil Merritt</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
