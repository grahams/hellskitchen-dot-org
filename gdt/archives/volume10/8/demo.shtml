R.I.T.  With a judicial hearing convening in a closed room seven stories above, students staged a rally at the Student Alumni Building to protest the impending suspension of Rochester Cannabis Coalition president, Shea Gunther.<br><dd>Approximately 250 students braved the relentless sun to show support and hear Kris Lotiliker, the RCC's treasurer and the organizer for the event, tell the story of Shea's non-violent resistance that lead to a violent confrontation with five Campus Safety officers.<br><dd>"I don't know if you know what Shea looks like, but there's no way he could've taken on five officers," Lotiliker and others repeatedly mentioned.<br><dd>Lotliker stated that, "One officer, Wayne Sutherland, reported receiving a cut above the eye, but when we saw him the next day he had nothing."<br><dd>The mic was then opened to students who came up one after the other to describe times when their rights have been violated by Campus Safety.  Most occurrences were unwarranted searches.<br><dd>Demonstrators then started chanting "Berry," in order to get the attention of Berry Calhane, vice president and Gunther's chief accuser.  Mr. Calhane came down from the meeting to say a few words and applaud the students for their lack of apathy.<br><dd>Dr. Al Simone, RIT school president was not available to speak at the protest, but did give a speech at another rally calling for RIT to put an end to racism and discrimination against the deaf in the whole world.  This rally was run by a club known as the BACC and held an hour later, fifty feet away and attended by about thirty.<br><dd>Dr. Simone, a member of what he repeatedly called in his speech, "the majority race," had more to say about the racist scrawlings of one or two of his students than the allegations of his Campus Safety's brutality, and he avoided mentioning anything about Shea.<br> <dd>After his speech, Dr. Simone surrounded himself with about eight attendants of BACC's rally, speaking non-stop, so no one could get a word in edgewise, while constantly talking about feedback.<br><table border align = center><tr><td valign =top align = center><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/dem1.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top align = center><font size = +2><B>Trying to burn one<br> down, Lotiliker <br>attempts to set fire to <br>the Student Rights <br>and Responsibilities<br> Handbook</B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br> <dd>Almost forty students remained for the outcome of the judicial hearing, which lasted over six hours.  Despite students' efforts and witnesses for Mr. Gunther's defense,  he has been suspended for one year and not allowed to return to campus in that time.  He will be allowed to negotiate with his teachers regarding his grades for this semester, but will be unable to complete his courses.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett </A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
