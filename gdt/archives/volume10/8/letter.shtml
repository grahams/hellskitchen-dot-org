However, the problems you experienced were entirely of your own making:<br><dd>Student rights do have their price.  The prices of these rights are called responsibilities.  If you ignore the "responsibilities", then you deserve no part of the "rights".  These rights and responsibilities are clearly defined in the "Student rights and Responsibilities Handbook." I believe that this is a document you hold near and dear to yourself. However, if you had taken the time to read through the entire handbook, instead of just skipping to the part about student rights, you would have found that you had broken many of the "responsibilities" laid out in the code of conduct.<br><dd>In your published letter in Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre, you state "They said [The Campus Safety officers] that I was not allowed in the building." Regardless of whether or not this was justified, you entered the building, in a direct violation of the order of a Campus Safety officer.  You were then told "not to go on the second floor."  However, by your account, you "went on the second floor."  This is a second violation of a direct order by a Campus Safety officer.<br><dd>Later, when the Campus Safety officers apprehended you, you were told to leave the building for a second time.  Again, you did not comply with the Campus Safety officers' request, a third violation of the RIT Code of Conduct.  Although you claimed that you had "done nothing wrong,"(Gracies Dinnertime Theatre, 29 April, 52 AT) you were clearly mistaken, because you had violated the RIT Code of Conduct three times.<br> <dd>If you had taken time to read further into the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, you would have found out that you violated at least three sections of the code of conduct, namely sections 7, 8 and 4.<p>Section 7 reads:<br><dd>7. FAILURE TO COMPLY: Failure to comply with directions of RIT officials or; law enforcement officers acting in performance of their duties, obstruction of the performance of these duties or failure to identify oneself to these persons when requested to do so;<br> <dd>You violated this policy at least three times.<br><dd>8.VIOLATION OF RIT POLICIES: Violation of published RIT policies, rules, and regulations including, but not limited to, the RIT Student Bill of Rights, the RIT Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment, the RIT Drug and Alcohol Policies, the RIT Parking and Traffic Regulations, the RIT Code of Conduct for Computer Use, RIT Academic Regulations, RIT Policy on Academic Dishonesty, RIT Smoking Policy, the RIT Residence Halls and Apartments Terms of Occupancy, and other published Institute policies, rules and regulations including those related to entry into and/or use of Institute rooms, buildings, and facilities.<br> <dd>When you violated section 7, you violated this policy as well.  Apparently, Mr. Gunther, your presence was intimidating to Mr. Barry Culhane.  I assume that he assumed that you were in the vicinity to disrupt the board of trustees meeting.  This worry is not unfounded, as you implied that you were going to bring the decisions of President Simone to the Board of Trustees.  (<I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>, 1 April, 52 AT.)<br> <dd>Mr. Gunther, I feel sorry that you may have been injured in your recent brush with Campus Safety.  However, I have no sympathy for you because your own admitted actions, regardless if they are justified or not, had a direct result in your consequences.  In closing, I quote again the RIT Student Rights and Responsibilities handbook. "Students are adults who are responsible for the consequences of their actions. An academic institution can and should discipline a student who violates institutional rules;  students are responsible for using common sense and prudence in looking after their own safety and the safety of their property. The institution can try earnestly to maintain a safe campus, but it cannot guarantee students that they will be safe in all circumstances."  I hope this incident may open the eyes of many people on both sides of this issue.<p><B>Works Cited</B><UL><LI>Gunther, Shea.
