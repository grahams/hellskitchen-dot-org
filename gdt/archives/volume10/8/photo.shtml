I thought I was a shabby operation compared to the other photographers present with their f-stops, foci, zoom lenses, camera cases and khaki colored safari clothing, but I think I did a good job in finding "the shot."  I'd go into a corner or crouch down or move back, take a picture, and within ten seconds, one of the more professional looking photographers (more khaki than a Gulf War corespondent) would take one from the same angle and with the same composition.<br><IMG   width = 150 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/pict1.gif"><br><dd>This happened not once, not twice, but three times... in a row!  She only stopped when I made it obvious that she wasn't going to get away with it.  I took her picture, taking a picture of the picture I just took.  I would've tried to keep in mind that "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," but I'm upset that I didn't even get a "Thank You."<br><IMG SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/pict2.gif"><br><IMG  width = 150 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/pict3.gif"><br><dd>So, if you're the teacher or photo editor of the class or publication this woman is working for, let it be known that <I>you're grading or paying the wrong person.</I><br></multicol></td></tr></table><table width = 500><tr><td valign = top align = center><font size = +2><B>Caught In the Act During Her Last Attempt.</font size></B>  The students above were sitting exactly like this for most of an hour.
