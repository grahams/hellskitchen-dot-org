Well, maybe not the end, but definitely a major caffofel. We've been measuring things in pyramid inches, reading our Bibles, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, Nag Hammandi, the book of Enoch.<br><dd>The <I>Weekly World News</I>. <A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>And everyone, including that smelly old man who rummages through our trash at three in the morning looking for tin cans and old socks, is saying pretty much the same thing: Benjamin Netanyahu has to die.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#248;</A></a><br><dd>I've asked the CIA to take him out, but they haven't replied to my communiques. I even asked Santa to deliver the goods, but all I keep finding in my stocking in the morning is coal and switches. Maybe it's because Netanyahu's death at this point in the game really wouldn't affect what's happening. There's too much inertia for one man's death to do little more than be a greasy, yellow spot on the windshield of prophecy.<br> <IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/1.1.gif"><br><dd>What Santa and the CIA have both realized, but don't let slip too often, is that killing Netanyahu won't work, because you always need a figurehead for evil. When you lie in bed all day and start on that new Hate Your Way to a Better Butt&#153; diet<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a>, you've got to focus your aggression on someone or you'll never pass that important 50 lb mark.<br> <dd>Netanyahu is nothing more than a glorified CIA automaton. If you take the time to think about it, you'll have to agree. No, you'll have to. They'll make you. Trust us.<br> <dd>Born in a foreign country, raised and educated in the United States, debriefed by the CIA, he's just what the US always wanted: the leader of a terrorist infested country to divert people's attention whenever politics on the home front starts to get uncomfortably introspective. Besides, no man his age could remain that attractive while running a country surrounded on all sides by large numbers of people who would enjoy nothing better than to disembowel you and wrap the token tourist Christmas tree with your entrails in honor of multiculturalism. Look at the man's forehead for Yhwh's sake! It's shiny and bright-the metal backing of his skull is coming through his skin.  You have to wonder if the CIA developed "Nu-Skin" -that famous aerosol that forms a protective layer over your last case of road rash- just for Big Bad Ben.  Perhaps every morning he gives himself a spritz, but by the end of the day under that hot Middle Eastern sun, the flesh tone wears thin.<br><dd>Oh! You don't have any idea what I'm babbling on about, do you? Well, I'm talking about the End Times here, folks. World War III, the coming of the Antichrist, the biggest downer in the world. (Hippies: Duuuude) But we got it sussed.<br><dd>All of the various prophets in the western world have said basically the same thing, but they can't seem to come to any consensus. I think it's because their all looking at things with different preconceived notions about what they're going to see. To reuse a metaphor that is crying and just wants to be left alone, it's like a bunch of blind men asked to touch an elephant (bad touch) and explain what it's like. One said it's like a large plant (after fondling the ears), another like a snake (after grabbing the trunk), and another like a tree (after getting stepped on by a foot). They're all describing the same thing, but from different perspectives. Luckily for you, the writers of GDT are able to take apparently separate and unrelated information and put it all together for your elucidation. Bare with us and you'll see where we're going with all this. It's funny later on, much like when the organic chemistry professor explains the reaction that produces explosions from cow dung for an hour and a half.<br><dd>Nostradamus predicted that there would be three antichrists, not just the one that John wrote about while tripping out on mushrooms and moss on beautiful, scenic Patmos. Really, it's quite a bargain. All these years the Christians have been advertising only one Antichrist, but all this time we could get three for the same price. Hot damn!<br><dd>Anyway, the first antichrist has been fairly conclusively identified by Nostradamus freaks as being Napoleon Bonepart. The second was Adolf Hitler, though he was actually called "Hisler" by Nostradamus. The third, who we'll talk about more in depth later, was also named, but as was often the case with the mystic he used a way to hide who it was (Look for the new Milton Bradley game "Hide the Prophetic Warnings of Doom" soon to be in stores near you).<br> <dd>Eight-balls were originally suspected of being able to bring clarity to the prophecies. In the age of corporate downsizing, however, their capabilities have been reduced to: "Outlook Not So Good," "Definately Not," "Yes Absolutely,"  "Reply Hazy," "Ask Again Later," "It Is Decidedly So," "Stop Shaking Me," and that Valley Girl favorite "Whatever."<br> <dd>For a long time I couldn't understand why Napoleon would be considered an antichrist.  Granted, he was born in the south of France, instituted the "retro" Greek architectural style of Neoclassicism, and his name closely resembles "naepolluon", Greek meaning "destroyer" or "exterminator," but he really didn't invoke images of fire, brimstone, and Christians asking me in a bored voice, "Have you been saved, brother?"<br> <dd>After several hours of thought and a number of carefully timed "hate breaks" (I was on an eight hour road trip to Maine and needed to reduce my love handles. Besides, what else is one to do but ponder apocalyptic prophecy and devote a lot of run time to hating?), it dawned on me that the three antichrists were people who, through their actions, laid the groundwork for the rise of the next.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>Take Mr. Bonaparte for example. Prior to him finding the French crown on the ground and picking it up with a sword, there wasn't really much of a sense of nationalism anywhere. People spoke French, German, Swahili, but the concept of ethnocentrism along these lines hadn't occurred to anyone. Napoleon managed to work people into such a lather over the concept that they spoke French and ate funny-shaped bread that he was able to use nationalism to unite the French for his battles across Europe.<br>  <dd>Of course he was defeated, but the meme of nationalism was now able to run amok (amok, amok, amok) throughout the world. When it combined with and corrupted the philosophies of Nietzsche's ubermen, <A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a> Adolf Hitler was able to create the most effective and powerful war machine the world had ever seen.  Borrowing tactics from the people they would persecute the most (presumably to avoid copyright lawsuits), the people of Germany banded together under a single fanatic to prove to the world that they wouldn't be pushed around anymore. Without a pear-shaped, jug-eared, unitesticular leader to rile them up about loyalty to the Fatherland, the Germans would have been just another group of xenophobic twats with a large arsenal and more sauerbrauten than you could shake a wet lemur at. Without a moral high ground to stand on or pretty uniforms to wear, any major military campaign is doomed to be unpopular. Fight the infidels, kill the French, wear a snazzy belt and shiny new boots, free the Holy Land, regain what is rightfully the Fatherland's, stop the spread of tuberculosis, kill the French again...even if an excuse has to be made up, there is always someone on a hill,<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#181;</A></a> waving a flag.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>In the course of Hitler's power play across Europe, several million Jews were slaughtered. Persecuted all across Europe ever since Paul made sure they took the fall for Jesus' death, rather than the Romans Paul was sucking up to,  the Jews were homeless and frankly sick and tired of it. The Diaspora was fun while it lasted, but everyone was overtired and just wanted to go home. Unfortunately, the Jews did not have a jug-eared, pear-shaped, unitesticular leader to rally behind, and some other group of gits was crowding up their chosenland.<br><dd>Luckily for them, it was the British that happened to control the area of Palestine. After a bit of trouble (war) and an argument (more war) a bit  of land was carved out (Kids: Very small rocks!) and on 14 May 1948, the nation of Israel was founded.<br><dd>Following the string of events? For those just joining us and in need of the Cliff Notes "Guide to World Domination", Napoleon's nationalism is used by Hitler to help provide a reason to murder millions of Jews who the British feel sorry for and give some grazing grounds in Palestine.Speaking of a people whose land was violently ripped from them and replaced with barren, extra crispy chunks of desert, let's talk about the Native Americans. (Trust us.  We're just print, we can't hurt you. We do this a lot.)<br><dd>The Hopi, best known for their impassioned pleas in the form of cornmeal and empty liquor bottles (KIDS: No deposit in D.C.) for membership of the various Indian Nations in the UN, have an ancient prophecy talking about shakings of the earth caused by the Great Spirit because not all of the world's people are playing nicely. When we attempted to contact the U.S. Geological Society for a statement on whether there was a connection between L.A.'s tense racial situation and the repeated earthquakes in southern California, they chose not to comment.<br> <dd>Anyway, one social shaking was the first world war, which resulted in the founding of the League of Nations. The Hopi asked whether the Indian Nations could join, but were, of course, berated by the civilized world. The second shaking of the earth was World War II, which brought about the founding of the United Nations. Again, the Hopi asked whether the Indian tribes could join, but were refused as the United States vetoed their right to enter.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/1.4.gif"><br><dd>The Hopi are now quite upset, gambling, and drunk off their wazoos, what with prophecy being fulfilled left and right. In their most recent gig at the UN the Hopi identified the international space station as the "great house thrown up into the sky where people live" spoken of in their prophecy and an indicator that the third shaking of the world is at hand. Most disturbing is that mankind has been watched over by the spirit world during past struggles, but in the coming wars, we will not retain our spiritual spectators (it seems they keep losing too many bets). The dead will leave us and we'll be alone with ourselves for the first time.<br><dd>Interestingly, the Hopi identify who will be responsible for the third shaking as one of the first to receive the light of God. In other words, the Jews.<br><dd>Antisemitism aside, I don't think it's that simple. Nostradamus, as with the other two antichrists, named the third. The name Mabus, however is enigmatic. Many people, grasping for a moral reason to go to war, have pointed out that Mabus backwards is Sadam. Though I refuse to believe that a two-bit dictator is the third antichrist, the Russians must feel otherwise. During the recent military buildup in the Middle East, poor President Boris "Absolute" Yeltsin warned that any military action against Iraq would result in WWIII and a marked decrease in the amount of the best part of the potato his liver would be forced to slog through.<br><dd>Still, that is too easy of an answer and doesn't fit with the prophecies of others. No, I think that the flipping of the name indicates that one poised against Mr. Hussein is the antichrist. Mr. Netanyahu, a Jew, and the man who has provoked the Palestinians wrath since he took office. He may not be the one directly responsible when Hussein attacks Israel, but he is the antichrist. In this case, it really does take two to start a fight. If one guy is standing in another's way and shouting in their face, "You want a fight? Come one. Come at me," and the other guy swings, who started the fight?<br><dd>So there will be war. Nothing new there. But contrary to what Edgar Cayce  had to say about earthquakes and floods raging across the United States, I'm fairly certain he made a misintrepratation. The coming age is that of Aquarius. As could be guessed from its name, it is symbolized by water and indicated by two jagged lines as a kind of shorthand. Personally, I think the floods and earthquarkes are nothing but the prophets way of interpreting the coming age of Aquarius. Floods? Well, duh. It's a water sign, and the earthquakes are the jagged lines.<br><dd>That's not to say that the United States won't get shit on. Quite to the contrary, when bombs start flying in the Middle East, the United States will undoubtedly come to the aide of Israel. Given the massive stockpile of conventional and nuclear weapons the US has, I seriously doubt that any country would openly attack us. However, a few crafty terrorists carrying suitcase nukes and biological weapons could put a major hurting on the US. Besides who can the United States attack in a terrorist war? It's really a no win situation.<br><dd>Hopefully, as with other major world conflicts, a new world body will be created. Whether it will be a totally new organization or a revamped United Nations is hard to say. I can let you know what's on my wish list, though: no veto power for any one nation. Let them all be equal and have their say. I'd also like to see a genuine World Court that actually had the power to enforce its decisions. None of this token judgement shit. If someone is accused of war crimes and doesn't show up for their court date, send in NATO or some world police organization to arrest them with force if necessary. Rule of law.<br><dd>How will you know that GDT was giving you the straight info? Well, when there is a terrorist attack at the 2000 Olympics in Australia, think back to this article.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; "Satan's head appears in cloud over Chicago."</A><BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#248; Okay, maybe the man rummaging through our trash didn't say that, but when he keeps muttering, "If you ain't got a penny, then -fghfgh yffg mfmfmf...," who's to know the difference?</A><BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#131; Soon to be released in <I>Cosmopolitan</I>.</A><BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#135; "Yah we is de supermen.
