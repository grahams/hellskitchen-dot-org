He's giving valuable lessons and he has done more for RCC's cause than all its members combined.  The last thing the RCC needed was to be accepted.  What would that teach them?  Law-makers at the Capitol won't just listen to you and vote for what you believe in.  In Washington D.C. there needs to be protest and screaming to drown out the sound of cash.  There needs to be an injustice by The Authority, by their own rules, in order to have wide range support.  Oh, and it doesn't hurt if there is a martyr.<br><dd>Quicksand: the more you struggle, the deeper you go.  History is full of examples of ideas taking over, simply because The Authority tried to stop them:  Democracy in the New World (1776) and France (1792), Spain (1808) and Mexico (1838), Communism in Russia (1917) and China (1921), Ghandi in India (1919), students in Hungary (1955), Democracy in the Czech Republic (1989) and Soviet Union (1991), Woman's Rights, Civil Rights, and the 1500's religious Reformation.<br><dd>Not all these ideas were good, but the simple fact that The Powers That Be attempted to silence them made them explode into fruition.<br> <dd>Another example of a bad idea: a government tried to quell someone who was rallying for political changes at a small bar and threw the speaker in jail.  Vast amount of support for him came flowing in from the community and all over the world.  The year was 1923.  The country was Germany.  The speaker was Adolf Hitler.<br>  <dd>If this process works for things as screwy and diverse as fascism and freedom, communism and democracy, personal rights and those who wish to take them away, imagine what it will do for just one simple plant.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
