OST is something easily recognizable.  You don't need to look for it, you just know when its there.  Aerosmith, David Bowie, Madonna, Eric Clapton, The Beastie Boys, not to mention the current kings of OST, The Rolling Stones - ALL possess the amazing skills and unique vision that allowed them to become successful many years back. There are not many music groups around these days that possess OST.  Most music these days is capitalistic post-modernism in which popular songs from the seventies and eighties are re-recorded and re-mixed by the likes of Puff Daddy and Orbital.  We've all heard it before, but we don't care cause anything sounds good to our aural palate.  Build a tolerance by having dance-mix USA pumped up your ass and you too could listen to Wyclef Jean's re-mix of "Stayin' Alive" without a grimace.  Remixing the Bee-Gees?  Do we really need to hear them again?  Next, I'll bet The Fugees will set their sights on the classics of more aged decades.  There's no doubt in my mind that I will one day walk into a music store and be confronted with any of the following:<p><UL><LI> "Duke-2-tha-muthafuckin-Ellington" - a collection of re-mixes featuring Puff Daddy, Method Man, and Snow.<p><LI> "Kickin' it wit da Count"  - Dr. Dre preaches on about "Holdin up dem fools on da 'A' train" in his soulful urban testimony to Count Bassie.<p><LI> "Holst-0909Euro Mix" - Gustav Holst's timeless ode to the various stellar bodies meets the room-thumpin phat jungle beats of DieselBoy.<p><LI> "Candle in the Wind: A Tribute" - Elton John's salute to Prince Harry, after his heart explodes while smoking crack out of a car antenna. Hardcore.</UL><dd>But I digress.  What I really want to talk about is another post-modern trend that     drives me up the wall and makes me long for a simpler, more original time.  This trend is OSWIFSA music. What kind of music? OSWIFSA.<br><B><dd>Obligatory Strong-Willed Introspective Female Solo Artist</B><p><dd>Wow.  Record labels realize that women can actually sell.  But should they?  If I had my way, I'd get them all in a parking lot a la "Dazed and Confused" and talk to them on terms they understand.<br><dd>AIR RAID BITCHES!!!  Line up!  Yeah, yeah.  Over here, I want all you Prairie Angst wenches.  This means you, Paula Cole.  Nobody gives a good goddamn whether Dewane is a loving husband.  Take your record contract money and buy a fuckin' dishwasher.  Shave your pits, put some shoes on, and shut your flaps.  Now over here, can we please line up the Heroin-Chic Perpetual Victims?  Move it Fiona!  I know, I know, yeah, this world is bullshit, yeah yeah yeah.  Go sit over there with Natalie.  She's new to the scene, but she's just as torn as you.  This is the Guitar-Thought table.  Any of you who own a guitar and have posed a thoughtful question to the world or to some intellectual ex-lover who made you feel dumb at the coffee shops, please sit here.  Lisa Loeb, park it here on the red chair.  And go get Edie Brickell, her new Bohimians, and Joan Osbourne. They can all sit here with Jewel and talk about how they can never quite duplicate the quality of the music videos at live shows.  Would the following women please report to the proctology department for immediate removal of your dead insects:  Alanis Morissette, PJ Harvey, Ani Difranco, Tracy Bonham, and Juliana Hatfield.  Once the dead carapace is removed, you might be able to write songs about things that don't bother you. You've got money.  Medicate yourself and leave the whining to Trent, Robert, and Morissey...<br><dd>You may say to yourself, "He's left out a bunch!" Remember OST?  The OSWFISA progenitors all have a lot of Old School Talent.  They INVENTED the genre.  So it makes me feel good to know that there are a few OSWIFSA's out there that still have what it takes.  They sit quietly back and smile as the little girls come out to play.  Rock out Joan Baez - queen mother of all that which is folk-statement.  Rock out Susan Vega - tell us some stories about pain, but don't let us know until the song is over and we have suddenly digested it.  Rock out Ella Fitzgerald - you were far naughtier for your time than anyone is today. That soulful voice paints a picture no other can.  Rock out Sarah and Liz - not quite old school, but witty and diverse enough to add something NEW to the style that is OSWIFSA.  Say hello to Carole King, Aretha Franklin, and give a smile to Janis if you see her.<br><table border><tr><td valign = top><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images8/tourist.gif"><br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><center><font size = +2> <B>Milk it Baby!</B></font size></center></td></tr></table><br> <dd>And Tori?  Well, I don't think that she can rock out anymore than she has. In a recent "Spin" magazine article, she said that she wanted to try live band music because she's taken the "chick at the piano" bit and milked it for all it's worth.  And why not?  She practically created the style herself.  She has every right to move on.  The good ones do that. Evolution is a major part of the OST.  The ability to adapt a good thing to make it better as the years go on is crucial.  She's still got it, and delivers yet again.  As the others bang on the pianos, violently strum their guitars, and pierce even more conspicuous body parts, Tori and the others, possessed of OST, chuckle.  And they should.  You can't beat the originals, unless you ARE the original and you're on another great adventure.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
