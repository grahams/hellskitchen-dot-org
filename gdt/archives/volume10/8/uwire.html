The full House is expected to vote on the amendment sometime in May.<br><dd>This so-called "Religious Freedom Amendment" is sponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Oklahoma, who sees the constitutional wall that separates church and state as needlessly high and is offering this amendment to "punch a large breach through the wall."<br><dd>The amendment would allow government officials in their official capacity to make decisions that favor one particular faith. And although prayers would not be organized by school officials, the bill would still allow students to impose their religious beliefs on fellow classmates by holding prayers at mandatory school events. It would also allow public funds to be used by religious institutions.<br><dd>A Constitutional amendment is simply unnecessary.<br><dd>Contrary to claims by its supporters, public schools are not hostile to students' religious expression. Students already have the right to pray in school, to read the Bible, and to distribute religious materials. But the proposed amendment would allow students to use school intercoms to lead classrooms in prayer and would mandate government funding of religious schools and houses of worship.<br><dd>Furthermore, if the proposed amendment actually increased "religious freedom" as its originators proclaim, why is it that several groups, both Christian and non-Christian, are strongly opposing the amendment? The opposition groups include: Southern Baptists; American Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Reform and Conservative Jews, the American Jewish Congress, the Baptist Joint Committee, the National Council of Churches, and numerous others.<br><dd>Some right-wing religious groups also are currently lobbying for school vouchers. This scheme would force federal taxpayers to support religious beliefs and practices with which they may strongly disagree. On the surface, the voucher program appears to help underprivileged youth in substandard public schools.<br><dd>This is not the case. Voucher programs, which are most often talked about in terms of "school choice," would actually abandon public schools, while concurrently draining desperately needed funds from our public education system. The NAACP, the national PTA, and other groups who have historically fought for the improvement of public schools, oppose the voucher program. In addition to that, they would violate the constitutional doctrine of the separation of church and state by diverting taxpayer money to religious, private, and parochial schools.<br><dd>Take this into consideration: The proposed amount for vouchers in the last Congress was $3,000 per student, while the median cost for a private school is over $10,000 per year. Explain to me how poor families could afford the additional $7,000-plus per year. Private schools would still be inaccessible to the poor.<br><dd>The concept of aiding the poor while helping inner city schools is nothing more than a elitist, conservative ploy. Conservative voucher proponents have only one goal: to subsidize religious education for the wealthy, while leaving those students who are financially less fortunate, with no hope and no opportunity.<br><dd>In this Congress, there are three bills that would create school voucher programs. Passage of these initiatives is a priority for the Religious Right. At the heart of both the Religious Freedom Amendment and the voucher program is the goal of merging government and religion.<br><dd>The Religious Right did score one victory last week. Despite the endorsement from the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the National Commission on AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences, the General Accounting Office, the National Institutes of Health, and numerous other groups, the Clinton Administration refused to allow federal money to be spent on needle exchange programs. This, despite the fact that the Clinton Administration actually supports needle exchange programs. They announced last week that needle exchange programs do reduce the number of new AIDS cases, while not encouraging illegal drug use. So what's the problem you ask?<br><dd>Guess who you can blame? That's right. Actually, that's Religious Right. Many AIDS victims are homosexuals and homophobic right-wing religious groups think of AIDS as divine retribution.<br><dd>On the other hand, the Christian Coalition did say in an April 20 press release that the, "Christian Coalition supports efforts to find a cure for AIDS." Whoopee! Finally there is a group willing to take that difficult stand. Actually, I'm sure there is some fine print that I must have missed somewhere stating that they support efforts to find a cure for AIDS, only if it was not acquired via homosexual intercourse.<br><dd>These closed minded Neanderthals somehow cannot grasp the concept that clean needles mean less death, not more drug use. In their April 20, press release, the Christian Coalition, "criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala for placing the U.S. government in the position of sanctioning illegal drug use." They also made the argument that "this is big-time kow-towing to the drug-legalization crowd."<br><dd>Not exactly. Last year, Shalala told Congress that the administration was satisfied that needle exchange programs do indeed diminish the spread of HIV. Until last week, the administration had said it remained uncertain on the question of whether exchanges inadvertently contribute to increased drug use, despite six major reviews of the research literature, including one by the National Institutes of Health last year, that found they do not. Now the administration too agrees they do not contribute to increased drug use, but still will not fund them.<br><dd>One would think that [fiscal] conservatives would actually endorse them given that they save money.<br><dd>How? The Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California-San Francisco says needle exchange programs cost about $9,400 per infection averted, versus the $119,000 lifetime cost of treating someone infected with HIV.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
