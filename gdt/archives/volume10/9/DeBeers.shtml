Prompted by the evil queen from Snow White's desire to "look beautiful for eternity", the repercussions could reshape marriage ceremonies worldwide by permanently tying the media and entertainment powerhouse of Disney with the marketing geniuses of De Beers.<br><dd>"Disney is world renowned for its ability to make people believe what they're seeing. From cartoons to theme parks, we provide illusion," said Disney CEO Michael Eisner. "It's only logical that we join forces with the same people who have made the world believe that diamonds are rare and valuable. Hell, they invented the engagement ring!"<br><dd>Best known for their "diamonds are forever" ad campaign, De Beers controls the supply of 3/4 of the world's roughcut diamonds, and effectively manage prices by restricting the number of diamonds on the market at any given time. With their acquisition of Disney, De Beers not only controls Disney's lucrative film and theme park franchise, but several entertainment networks including ABC, ESPN, and a host of other associated companies that have forced Baptists to live as Luddites since voting to avoid Disney.<br><dd>"ABC is a family oriented network," said Nicky Oppenheimer, chairmen of De Beers. "Above all, diamonds are about family. Wives and brides-to-be want the immortal, incomparable shine of a diamond. Diamonds, just like true love, are forever. How much more family oriented can you get.<br><dd>"With this merger we can help teach those family values to children while they watch Saturday morning cartoons, and remind beer hogs watching ESPN to take some time to show her he'd marry her all over again and bring some magic back into their tired, mundane lives."<br><dd>As a part upcoming advertising campaigns, De Beers and Disney will announce the Engagement Moon, where couples recently engaged go on a vacation to enjoy each other's companies. "It's a tradition that can be traced back to the times of the Indian maharajas and Arabian princes, and was called 'bundling' in the Northeast United States during the 1800s. What better place to go on your engagement moon than one of Disney's theme parks?" Jessica Rabbit said during a phone interview.<br><dd>Disney's seven dwarfs, unemployed since the marriage of Snow White, have already made preparations to begin overseeing the mining of De Beers' diamonds in South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.<br><IMG align =right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/debeers.gif"><br><dd>"We're ecstatic about this," Eisner remarked. "The people at De Beers were a bit concerned that Dopey might be a threat to security, but after gimping him, plans have progressed without a hitch."<br><dd>News of the merger electrified world financial markets. Disney shares surged an astounding 43 percent, while De Beers simply tried to evade U.S. trust-busters.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/mjw.html">Matthew J Weaver</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
