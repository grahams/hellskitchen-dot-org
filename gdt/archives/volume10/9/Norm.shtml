I had heard rumors that the University of Rochester's official satire magazine, The Norm, had gone under and decided to get confirmation, but actually hearing that their budget had been slashed from $7000 to $30 was still a shock.<br><IMG align =right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/norm1.gif"><br><dd>I first met people from The Norm just about a year and a half ago. Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre had run a quick editorial addressed to the staff of The Norm saying that, rather than competing, we wanted to work together with them. Prior to our expansion onto the University of Rochester in 1995, we didn't even know UofR had a satire group. We simply assumed that UofR was a backward as RIT.<br><dd>Anyway, upon meeting The Norm in their office in the basement of Wilson Commons, we made our introductions. Of all the groups of people I've met while working for GDT and Hell's Kitchen, The Norm was one of the most wound up I'd ever seen. Led by their editrix at the time, the staff of The Norm led the representatives of the member groups of Hell's Kitchen through a roller coaster of sights and activities. We were showed their toys, their wall of random pictures, and their displays of old issue covers.<br><dd>We were even given cake!<br><dd>After a short time it became clear that The Norm wasn't interested in working along with us. At one point, while discussing finances of our respective groups, we were shocked to learn they had a budget of $7000 for two issues a year, while we weekly limped along with not even half of that at the time<br><dd>"Wow! Imagine what we could do with $7000," I said to B.J. Leopold, editor of the Melancholy Predator (1995-1997).<br><dd>"Yeah. You could buy a better photocopier," came a snide remark from one of The Norm's staff.<br><dd>Ouch.<br><dd>After another 15 minutes or so, we all left, thinking we'd done the right thing by introducing ourselves and offering to work with them. Later we discovered what happened after we left.<br><dd>It appears that organocentrism is rampant among student groups. One of the founding principles behind Hell's Kitchen was is help bind related groups together under a non-academic controlled group so they can all achieve more. Well, The Norm evidently didn't see it that way. Though I wasn't there, it appears The Norm's editrix began working on a little group cohesion, saying how much better they were and how they'd show us.<br><dd>Well we waited. In the meantime, The Norm had a defector, Clare Terni, who worked the Predator and eventually made it metamorphosize into the Melancholy Homewrecker.<br> <dd>Still, we waited. Spring came and there was no new issue of The Norm. Fall came, and again, no Norm. Spring as come and has gone for the University of Rochester and The Norm failed to produce any material for publication.<br><dd>So I have mixed feelings. Given, they were aggressive toward the Kitchen, a group which GDT is a member of and has agreed to help defend, but it would have been so much nicer if they had agreed to work with us. We might have been able to help them through whatever problems they ran into that forced them to effectively disband a group that had been publishing since 1986.<br><IMG align =right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/norm2.gif"><br><dd>I'm sure there's a lesson here, somewhere. Hopefully it's that groups achieve more by cooperating than competing. With that noble idea in mind, I invite any group that would like to join Hell's Kitchen to do so. Radio stations, publications, theatre groups, computer interest groups-it doesn't matter if you're students or not. That's why we think Hell's Kitchen is such a great idea: it crosses traditional university lines to  include three campuses in a single community, along with the city of Rochester. MCC, RIT, and the University of Rochester are necessarily limited to organizing activities on their respective campuses. Hell's Kitchen has gone rogue, and though it is base on RIT (only because that's were it get the most support), it is not controlled by RIT.<br><dd>So join us and let's see what a bunch of us can do when we work together.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
