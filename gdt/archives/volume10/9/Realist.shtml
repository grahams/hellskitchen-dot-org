The week before, Fremen mice; last month, postal workers.  In one issue it was Alien Invaders with a sense of graphic design AND nine foot tall gestalt sea-monkeys.<br><dd>Despite our absurdity, all of these ideas are just as entertaining and plausible as the $100 million plus grossing "Independence Day," if not more. This past week, however, science has gotten involved. In the same way scientists replaced human errors in calculations at the grocery store with automated telephone bills, off by a few hundred thousand dollars, this week they gave us a disaster above their usual fare. Forget our need to recycle our filthy, insignificant planet, microscopic alien bacteria, and the much feared asteroid:<br><dd>The end of the universe is at hand!<br><dd>GRB 971214 is the newly discovered Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) in the night sky near a smudge, Galaxy ESO 184-82, in the Big Dipper.  It is estimated as being the 2nd largest known cosmic explosion, the Big Bang taking a recently uncontested first.<br>  <dd>"What do you care?" a nay-sayer has asked, mocking me like Chicken Little.  "This explosion was millions of light years away  -it won't reach us until long after the sun has burnt out."  I'll agree that this heretic may be more well read on quantum physics, time dilation and singularity event horizon theories than me, but he's no Stephen Hawking, and I know Stephen must be uneasy.<br><dd>Recent speculation (Astronomers at the Anglo-Australia Observatory at Coonabarabran, May 8, 1998) says it's a black hole forming after a star 10 times larger than our sun had gone supernova. According to the Australian scientists, it's only 100 million light years away. Personally, I think it's a whole new universe.<br><dd>Usually these rare GRB things are noticed as very faint radio waves in the distant reaches of the universe, but these same astronomers have compared this one to being "right in our own backyard."<br><dd>The light from that explosion is already here; we can see it and it's getting larger.  How are we sure that the light we see hasn't been traveling for longer than 100 million years, having been slowed down by the immense light-bending temporal vacuum that is right behind it?  In the past week it has doubled in size.  I bet old Stephen is crapping his pants right now.<br><dd>My nemesis once said that as your crap approaches the speed of light it gains infinite mass.  Looks like someone out there might have just done it.  (Kids: Akira!)<br>  <dd>"Well I hope you're happy! Had to go and make a new universe!  The old one wasn't good enough for you, was it?"<br><dd>So it's on its way, just thought I would like to warn you.  It might be 30 or it might be hundreds of years before the concussion barrier of this other universe with its different aspects of time, space and architectural fashion hits us at home.<br><IMG border SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/blackhole.gif"><br><dd>In that time the constellations will have new company, and eventually you'll be able to see GRB971214 as big as the moon.  Future lovers may see an era of erotic poems that will regard it as a highly sexual cosmic phenomenon.   In that time it'll be visible during the day and families will picnic under heaven's twin lights, the sun and the elegant GRB 971214.   While this is happening, gravitational forces will be havoc:  Earthquakes, volcanoes, extreme weather and tides, and lunatics.  (There is a link between gravity and madness, and times are going to swing.)<br><dd>Who knows?  Maybe gravity travels faster than light and we are already on the edge, being sucked into the multidimensional abyss. With things being so strange lately we haven't noticed.  What with the floods and the hurricanes, and the pollution and Chernobyl, not to mention mythical and Biblical prophecies, UFOs, and the ever-growing coincidental occurrences that surround us (You know they are happening, don't pretend they're not.) I wish I could expand on this, but I have to make this quick: The nay-sayer also said that as we hit the event horizon, or the speed of light, it would appear to an outside observer as if we were frozen in time forever. Well, I want to make an impression on eternity and I'm not going to be able to do that from behind a typewriter.  I need to go to Mexico, get drunk, pass out in a ditch and possibly wake up with a tattoo saying "Jean Arby's - Dec. 14, 1997" on one arm and a hooker on the other.   See you again in the fall...  maybe.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
