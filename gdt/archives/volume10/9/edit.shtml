As often as not, we would prefer readers to disagree with our stance rather than support it. While discussing last week's main article in which we proposed that Benjamin Netanyahu was the 3rd antichrist with a companion of mine I was advised to tread lightly on the subject. I was told that putting such ideas into the minds of various people, people who might stretch and mutate an idea to the extent of using it as an excuse for violence, was too dangerous and ought to be curbed. I was told that if I would not include some sort of warning label to make clear to people that the intent of the article was not to do harm, then I would be responsible for the callus actions of a few who might not understand the basis of our humor.<br><dd>As is always true with my companion, if I do not comply with her wishes, then I am automatically assumed to be wrong. Any and all responses at such a time are worthless and ignored as I am not enlightened enough to understand the right course of action. So any answers I give to her fall on deaf ears.Yet this question was raised! It possess many valid points, and I believe it is important enough to address to the world in general.<br> <dd>Just as a boxer never pulls a punch unless he's got money riding on the other side, a magician never tells his secrets unless he's being paid by the FOX Network, real bar room brawls are never engaged with sugar "glass" bottles and balsa wood chairs, and assassinations are never carried out with a gun full with blanks, so too is a satire explained and watered down for the weak-willed and weaker-minded no longer what it was meant to be. The definition of satire defies this idea.<br><dd>Jonathan Swift's <i>Modest Proposal</i> would never have been so highly acclaimed were it as modest as its title. Humor devoid of satire leaves in its wake merely childhood knock-knock jokes, ass wipe humor, sexist, racist and stereotyping propaganda, and the absurd: humor without position, clarity and bite. It would be like owning a box of 64 Crayolas&#153; devoid of pigment, utterly useless, yet still non-toxic when swallowed.<br><dd>The entirety of my prior list is filled with the building blocks of humor, and satire surely enlists their help to perform its own duties, but satire is more urbane then the sum of its parts. It certainly comes filled to the brim with the coarser more vile humor, but at the same time it creates something greater. Satire is found within the verbal tip of the hat, wink or nudge. It is found in the twist of a word or the melodic dance that ensues within a sentence. It is a binding of the real, the absurd, the mundane, and the grotesque; what is thought to be real, what is real, and what no one would dare even think.<br><dd>When we write our articles we think on an idea and expose it to a new light. We merely want to show another angle, an issue more or less skewed than it has been presented in the past. Our goals are to force people to use their minds, to ask them nicely and then club them on the head.<br> <dd>Should we be responsible for the acts of others on our words?<br><dd>Yes.<br><dd>Should we make it easier for all people to understand, to produce this vague shadow of the world just to make it look nicer or friendlier to others?<br><dd>Were I to answer yes to such a thing, I would approve of ideas that say all students must pass their classes so as not to hurt their fragile feelings. I would be a proponent of allowing those who, through trickery and treachery, are entirely supported by those in the world who are willing to do their own share of work. I would be saying that no one should be praised above another for striving to do what they feel is right.<br><dd>If you haven't already determined my position in this I will say only this: I do not believe in coddling people into not thinking or using the capabilities of their minds, and I do not believe in allowing a sense of apathy or banality to excuse someone from taking control of their own life. I feel my responsibilities strongly, but those responsibilities do not include kowtowing to the lowest common denominator.<br> <dd>A world unwilling to work for understanding and knowledge is a world unable to hear or tell the truth in all its varied forms, and a world I'm unwilling to live in.</multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
