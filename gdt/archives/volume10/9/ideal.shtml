You know, the sense that the world is an astounding place full of possibilities, where good guys really do win and if you work hard enough, you'll get what you want; where the sound of rain can make you smile and watching clouds wasn't a waste of time, but a crucial exercise. I can't speak for the rest of you, but at the tender age of 24, I still feel that way.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/1.1.gif"><br><dd>For that reason, I'm tagged as an idealist. "Oh, you'll change your mind when you're older,"I was told when I was 18. "The world isn't as ideal as you seem to think it is,"I was reminded at age 21. "It must be nice to be young and think you're invulnerable,"a patronizing woman said yesterday as she tripped over her colostomy bag.<br> <dd>Frankly, everytime I hear these sentiments, I'm shocked. I suppose the young idealists are branded as immature, the middle aged as hippies, and the aged...eccentric (KIDS: Spruce Goose!). Here I am, living my life as I see fit, bypassing obstacles - sometimes destroying them - and I'm told by men and women who are old before their time that the life I lead is unrealistic...that I should be more like them.<br><dd>I know people younger than myself who are the most jaded, bitter people I have ever met (Interestingly, most of them are in some way involved in a profession dealing with computers. Whether there is a connection between using computers and being a prick remains to be seen). There's always a quip on the lips, the tongue ready to lash out and hurt if it can. Physical wounds are easy to see and treat. A broken bone. A lacerated limb. A bruised eye. The pain done to one's soul by a truly malicious comment goes unseen, like an infection. Those "sensitive artists"out there who languished through the horror of junior high and high school know what I mean: where a laugh in the hall would make one stiffen in apprehension, awaiting the inevitable kick or shove, or worse, the whispering that you irrationally knew was about you. We all carry our scars. Some healed over long ago, but some are still open and festering.<br><dd>There are times in everyone's life when they face a decision that will help shape their world view...their sense of life. All too often it is easier to allow the momentum surrounding the lives of other people to sweep you away in a direction that you don't necessarily agree with (Kids: Non-elastic collision!). When faced with a decision, it's so easy to accept the world as it is-a rather large and intimidating place. But to see something which is wrong and fight against it is an active decision and sets one apart as an idealist.Idealists fall, however; if they didn't then I wouldn't have had to put up with people's patronization as they explained that I will change my mind when I get older, as though age somehow erodes one's foundations. In a world filled with mugged liberals (a.k.a. Realists), it is almost impossible to escape hearing discouraging words,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> and eventually succumb to the siren song of doubt. Evil begets evil (can I get a hallelujah out there?). You needn't look any further than the aforementioned pricks for evidence. Most people with a harsh word on their lips, ready to pierce one's flesh, are the same people who were once on the receiving end of the taunts they recycle. To survive under adverse conditions, humans adapt. We learn how to survive in any environment. Place a child, self assured, confident, and kind into an evil setting, and the child will, unwittingly, become a bastard...simply to survive.<br><dd>Adults (I must differentiate myself from them because of my idealism) continue to drive home that the world is unfair and cruel, where people will take advantage of you at every opportunity. I'm sorry, but that's the world people chose to live in.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>In an imperfect world, idealism is a necessity in spite of what realists may spout.  Without it, change in the world would not be possible. Imagine: it's the first Continental Congress and the Founding Fathers are sitting down to talk about plans for the future. The entire assembly is filled with idealists and dreamers, envisioning a better place to live. Suddenly a computer programmer, making $80k a year comes in and joins the discussion...<br><dd>"I think democracy is the only fair way to govern -- "<br><dd>"Ha! Democracy? You don't mean universal manhood suffrage, do you?  We would have to free the slaves!  Or do you mean let land owners vote? Most of these people can't even read and you want to give them the decision on who should lead the country?"<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>"Well, maybe if we choose a king..."<br><dd>"We've already got a king. His name is George <A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a>. And what makes us think we can beat him anyway? We're talking about the British military. They're the same people who brought us such greats as the Defeat of the Spanish Armada&#153;, the Conquest of Ireland&#153;, and everyone's favorite,the Genocide of the Scots&#153;. I just don't think a bunch of farmers and, forgive me, 'idealists' can beat them. I know, let's go throw books at them."<br><dd>It's so easy to inject self-doubt and evilness into an idea that can work. Given, most ideas simply will not succeed; that's the nature of the game. There are enough obstacles in the way of ideas without introducing dross<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#181;</A></a> into the center and undermining the entire infrastructure.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>Misery loves company.<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#135;</A></a> That's the only way I can explain what I see: People who lead mundane lives, yet hold a spark of defiance, explain to me that my sense of life is juvenile.<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#164;</A></a> Juvenile, not necessarily because my way of life is impractical, but because my critics shared it at one point, and have allowed it to fade away.<br><dd>If one's hopes and dreams are denied by an outside source, it is human to fight for what we feel is right.  We will tear asunder those that stand in our way if we can. When we deny ourselves what we want most, something goes wrong. The fires that would have been used to fight are damped. The flame of desire slowly lessens until one day we wake up to a nine to five job, having sex with our partner on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays, and only rarely thinking back to foolish dreams of being an author or traveling the world.One has to eat, after all.<br><dd>The world is what we make it. You live in your worlds of work you hate, studies you aren't interested in, and people you really don't like. Stop. Don't do anything you don't want, but don't be stupid, either. If you really want, with all your heart, to be a graphic designer, but dislike college, stay with the studies; it's a means to an end. Sometimes I don't feel like eating, but I know I have to so I can...live and, uh, do stuff. We're rational animals capable of long term planning. Use that ability.<br><dd>Fill your life with joy, gentleness, and absurdity, and your world is more forgiving than someone who obsesses on loneliness, stupidity, and petty selfishness. Actively choose to live your life. I've heard it said that the greatest act that one can perform is to lay down their life for another. Though emotionally powerful, I have to disagree. People lay down their lives daily when they get out of bed and do things they despise with all their being. It is so much more noble to live for oneself, in joy and creativity. Fear and loathing are death. Rather than dying for another, do you dare to live for yourself?Keep your idealism. Of course it is silly, but so is war and famine and the Republican Party and we keep those around. Work toward your dreams, if for no other reason, so you can look back at everyone who told you your ideas were childish and say, "I did this! I am here, now, and I did what you were afraid to do."<br><dd>Make your lives extraordinary.<br></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#163; 5 out of 6 GDT staff members don't know what this means.</A><BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#165;Except in the plain states, where few discouraging words are uttered, and if they are uttered, no one listens.</A><BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#134;And the electoral college was born.</A><br><A HREF="#4.4">&#131;And I'll hold him and love him and hug him....</A><br><A HREF="#5.5">&#181;True, true.
