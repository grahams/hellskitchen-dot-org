A formal dance, accompanied by fine dining is just the thing to punctuate the coming of spring in the lives of teenagers.  With the boys in tuxedos, and the girls in dresses, there is always a fun time in store.  One must remember some important factors however, in order to prevent unnecessary mishaps.<p><b>Dinner: </b>Good dinner in which one acts immature in rented or expensive clothing (see "white trash prom") is a must.  Cloth napkin clothing is a must, with sailor hats for the gentleman, and napkin boobies for the ladies in the house.  Always play with your food.  Ladies should also order a modest priced entree, so that when picking at it, their date won't feel like his supper money is feeding a socially-induced eating disorder.  Remember girls, breath mints are a must after vomiting your dinner into the toilet before moving on to the dance!<p><b>Dancing:</b> Dancing badly - you're white, face it.  But you're ahead of most Caucasians in that you've taken lessons.  When everyone else is grinding up against each other in a clumsy Eurhythmic tribute to "C'mon Ride the Train", you can tear it up with something spectacular.  Make sure that you also have a stupid dance circle.  If some guy in one of the other "Go ___________, it's your birthday..." circles is thrusting his pelvis toward someone other than his date, you've got to be sure that there's a guy in your circle who is doing "The microwave".  Or "The Potters Wheel", "Picking up change", "The lumberjack (needs two sawing down a tree)", "The defibrillator", or that dance where you grab one leg behind you, and thrust outward on one foot.  I requested "The Time Warp", and it was very cool to see those who had done it before, do it in formal wear (just don't go all the way to the floor).  It was also cool to watch the upper-crust socialite Rocky newbies attempt to emulate the moves of the "geekier", yet better cultured others.<p> <b>Foot Massages:</b> Foot massages in the limo back are a must.  I don't care how fucking tired you are, or how badly you think your feet smell.  They don't smell that bad, and it is the proper gentleman who rubs down the sore dogs of his date.  It is statistically proven that 90 percent of massages and/or tickling leads to sexual contact in one form or another, so don't be squeamish guys.<br>  <dd>Ladies, if your date does not submit to this task, you have the right to shove his boutonniere up his ass.<p><b> A NOTE ON DRINKING:</b> Most of your prom chaperones are drunk.  Ask them.  If you have brought a hip flask of Peppermint Schnapps or the like, it is customary to inquire as to if your chaperones would like some.  But only the cool ones.  I suggest that one "So Cool" teacher that everyone had at one time or another.  They're usually up to it.   Don't ask the principal because she probably brought her own (as did Jim "Beam" McGregor at my senior prom) and won't need any of yours. Save it for the ones who forgot.<br><dd>When drinking after the prom, I highly recommend the followingLong Island Iced Tea - Some twisted genius came up with this one somehow. Funny, I didn't use any tea in making this...<br> <UL><LI>1 oz tequila<LI> 1 oz vodka<LI>1 oz rum<LI>1 oz dry gin<LI>16 oz Coke<LI>1 tbs. lemon juice<li>1 tbs. instant dissolve sugar</UL>Directions:  Mix the first four ingredients in a large tumbler.  Add lemon juice.  Pour this mixture into two tall glasses.  Add ice and Coke evenly to each.  Add sugar to each.  Mix well.<p> <b>Tourist's Rum and Coke:</b><br><UL><LI>Solo cup of ice<LI> 1 1/2 oz Bacardi light rum<LI>1 can of Coke<li>1 lime wedge</UL>Directions:  Pour rum into cup.  At a height of about three feet above the cup, pour the can of Coke into the cup until it foams too much to add any more.  Squeeze and deposit the lime wedge in the cup.  Do not try this if you've already had the iced tea.  Depth perception may be impaired.  Pour from a safer distance of no more than three inches.<p><b>EMERGENCY DIRECTIONS: </b>In the event that you lack some of the necessary materials for the above concoction (like uhhhh....I don't know....CUPS maybe!) you can do what is known as a "Stanley Double Fist".  Take the flat two liter of coke in your left hand.  Take the fifth of cheap rum in your right.  Take a swig on the rum, then a larger swig of the coke. Swish briskly in your mouth for about three seconds then swallow.  Do this until you loose parallax vision.<p><b>A WORD ON VOMITING:</b> If you need to vomit, do so in the appropriate receptacles.  They include the toilet, a trash can, outside in the grass, or in a Safeway bag.  They do not include the floor, under the cushions of the couch, the pool table, Ryan Wilkinson's head, Eric Wilkinson's shirt, the chess table, my bed, or in a potted plant on the deck.  Remember if one needs to vomit in the sink (see "My friend Matt at Senior Week"), be sure to clean any dishes you soil in the process.  Also, common courtesy dictates that if you have successfully vomited, but are remaining near the toilet "just in case", you must yield to other vomiters.  And ladies, lift the toilet seat after you use the bathroom.  We don't just leave it up because we're lazy after we urinate.  We keep it up in case we feel the need to heave copious amounts of chunder into the commode without soiling the seat too badly.<p>   <b>URINATION: </b>Rules for urination are basically the same as the rules for vomiting, but be sure to add the following to your list of unacceptable containers:<br>  <dd>The vegetable crisper in the refrigerator, the ice tray Matt Zimmerman's clean laundry<p><b>FIFTH WHEELS: </b>The "fifth wheel" is someone we could all do without.  If you've gone to the prom "just as friends", and your date decides to git jiggy wit someone else at the after prom party, do not disturb!  This also applies to other couples as well.  If someone is trying to "hit that shit Doggy style", it is impolite to remain in the room, closet, railing, etc.  Best to quietly excuse yourself and find someone that you yourself can screw around with. And no pictures, as tempting as they may be.  They always fall into the wrong hands.<p><IMG align = center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol10/images9/tourist.gif"><br><b>SMOKING:</b> Everyone knows that a good night of drinking cannot be accomplished without a decent amount of smoking, cigarettes or otherwise.  Remember, cigarette smoke not only stimulates the release of dopamine, but it also inhibits the coenzyme responsible for breaking it down from working. Filters are for pre-schoolers.  Choose your cigarette brand with a bit of gusto.  Lucky Strike, Chesterfield, Pall Mall, and Camel unfiltered are all fine brands.  If you feel the need to smoke a substance other than tobacco, be careful.  Nobody likes to sleep where the bong water got spilled!  Proper joint passing etiquette is a must, and any avid drug user will tell you that single puff-pass is the most economical for a large group.  Shotgunning is acceptable, as long as the passing order is not broken, and there is enough to go around.  Save your roaches for later, or eat them if you so desire.  Just don't leave them where mom or pop can find them.  You don't want to explain that little bugaboo!<p><b>THE MORNING AFTER: </b>Sunglasses are a must.  Party guests should leave as soon as possible, in order to shower and remove the booze-weed-sex odors from both clothing and body.  Keep tabs on your rented gear.  If you decided to take it off and put sweat pants on for easier access after the dance, make sure that you grab your pile and not someone else's.  Don't make yourself feel even more paltry at the mercy of those pretentious assholes at the tux rental store. They've already made it painfully aware that you don't own that outfit - you don't need them breathing down your neck when they realize you've brought back the wrong one.  Leave during the early morning hours, and you won't get guilt-tripped into cleaning up the party aftermath.<br> <dd>All in all, prom is an exciting time for everyone, from the students, to the rent-a-cops and under-cover narcotics agents.  Keep these simple rules in mind, and your prom is sure to be a rousing success, and an experience to remember for a lifetime...<p></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume10/authors/mjw.html">Matthew J Weaver</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
