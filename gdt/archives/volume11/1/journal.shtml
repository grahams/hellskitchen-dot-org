A story broke on Channel 13 News (WOKR) about a friend of mine.<br><dd>There is some relevant background to this story: my friend was released from prison eight and a half years ago. The first time I met him was shortly after his release. I will not tell you that he had been falsely incarcerated or falsely accused. He had done some offensive things in his past. I'm not inclined to prattle on about the details, but suffice it to say he was a multiply convicted felon. A societal threat in his day.<br><dd>However in the last leg of his incarceration a change had taken place. He was sick of his life and where it had led him. Wanting to make a difference, he attempted to help children growing up in similar situations to his own upbringing. He wanted to show them how to avoid making the same mistakes he had made. He sincerely wanted to make up for what he had done.<br><dd>Over the last eight and a half years, he has done just that. He has worked through multiple organizations to help children in chaotic circumstances avoid taking the wrong road. He has also helped other convicted felons eschew a continued road of violence. He has even worked with the mayor on several projects. He has helped more people in this community than I can imagine. Just this summer he asked for my assistance in tutoring a couple of young high school students in math, to help them attain their degrees.<br><dd>But, like most men with a past, he wonders if he's done enough. He often thinks he has not, and it has haunted him. An old compulsion of his has also been haunting him, a gambling problem. The kind of problem that can slowly, subtly creep out of control.<br><dd>Recently he was experiencing some money problems. Debts were mounting from his gambling habit. His self esteem was falling as he tried to hide the truth from his friends, so they would not feel as disappointed in him as he felt in himself.<br><dd>Everyone goes through hard times, everyone makes poor choices, everyone has to live with the consequences of those decisions, and yet those consequences should be within reason. My friend made a poor choice, drawing on his past in a time of trouble. He stole somebody's wallet in a grocery store, and got caught. When questioned by police, he denied nothing and confessed his actions.<br><dd>The courts could go one of two routes: treat this behavior as a misdemeanor and give him a short prison sentence, or because of his prior record (twenty years prior) treat it as a felony conviction and give him a minimum of fifteen years to life imprisonment.  I don't believe that my friend deserves to walk away without penalty. On the contrary, I believe a little punishment is important to remind him how fragile his current situation is, but let it be tempered with reason and not hysteria. Prior to the newscast given by Channel 13, it seemed the prosecutor in the case was inclined to be more lenient on my friend, because of his clean record for twenty years and his service to the community. After the broadcast, however, the political tide had turned and the prosecutor would be shown publicly as being too soft on crime if he did not pursue a full felony sentence.<br><dd>Channel 13 had taken this friend of mine and highlighted his prior criminal record and asked the question 'how?'. How could the mayor place a convicted felon in a position where he'd have access to children? The answer of course was that the kids found they could relate to his experiences and would listen to his warnings and advice. He's made a powerful difference for many children, showing them that they have more choices than it seems at first glance. This question Channel 13 asked was not the crux of their issue. They highlighted an incident from the past that was never even substantiated. This is where their integrity had faltered. This is where they took everything he had done in service for this community and vilified it.<br><dd>There was a twenty year old incident in my friend's past in which two friends of his had assaulted a man. The man saw two of his assailants before he was blindfolded or otherwise made unable to view his attackers. He was beaten. When the police investigated, there was a charge of sodomy along with the assault. The victim accused many people of involvement in the attack, including my friend and the known assailants.  He had implicated my friend simply because he had  associated with the two assailants in the past. So my friend was charged for this assault.<br> <dd>At the same time that he was charged with this assault he was being accused of a much worse crime for which the sentence was pending. In order for it not to reflect badly upon this second case, he pleaded the assault down to a lesser charge and accepted it. In the time preceding his sentencing the investigation into the assault determined that there was not enough evidence to sustain the victim's claims, and the case was thrown out. My friend, however, had already pleaded his assault charges down and was therefore unable to have it removed from his record.<br><dd>So when Channel 13 learned of the "sodomy" charge, they pounced at the opportunity to set up a perfectly vile juxtaposition. They asked how the mayor could allow a convicted felon that had been accused of sodomy to work with children. The implication was, of course, child abuse and sexual misconduct, and this misinformation was accordingly well received by the viewing public.<br><dd>I've learned that just after this "news article" aired, a mutual acquaintance of ours who had seen it, called up another and said that my friend had been arrested for rape. Rape? How does someone determine rape from a charge of purse snatching?<br><dd>I'm sure that Channel 13 would defend itself by insisting that it had not said anything about rape and that it was the fault of this viewer who had merely assumed incorrectly. But I'm afraid I can't let them wriggle their way out of this situation that easily. You see, half of an article is what is said, and the other half is implied. Whether they say it or not, they made an irresponsible implication simply by how they sequenced their story and juxtaposed the available information. They implied child abuse and sexual abuse when they placed the word "sodomy" near the word "child." They drew a picture of a far worse crime neglecting to state what he had been initially arrested for and what he was finally charged with. The world needs a fantastic story and what is not really in the story can be inferred to make it more colorful.<br><dd>The only problem is that what they were colorfully slandering a man's life. A real man's life; not a story, not a scoop, not another dreg of humanity on which some aspiring reporter could climb to better fame for "protecting the community".  They ruined my friend's life, they've torn at his spirit and his heart. He's lost his job, and he may lose the rest of his life to incarceration, because he made a mistake and someone at Channel 13 had a torch to bear.<br><dd>My friend is carrying on now, crutched by the help of his supporters. The prosecutor is fighting hard for a felony charge because of the negative publicity brought by Channel 13. In recent days things have been looking a little better. The judge at one hearing had stated that he had never seen such an extraordinary public outpouring on the behalf of one man before. It is probably because such an extraordinary person seldom finds himself in such circumstances. In the mean time all of his friends are praying for a light sentence and reason to outweigh political game playing.<br><dd>And to the members of Channel 13, I salute you.  Your inquisitive nature and journalistic intuition has truly aided the people of this city.  Now that you have destroyed one of Rochester's strongest role models, you can probably look forward to reporting more colorful, violent crimes. <br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
