I asked as she finished her crumb and began chewing on the edge of the issue of Rolling Stone with a very fey<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> IRA member on the cover.<br><dd>"You should know by now that I don't give a rat's ass, no pun intended," she said as she pooped in Michael Collin's urn, "about micro or macro nationalism. I know you're a proponent of Hanseatism and are upset by the forces of Balkanization, but what bearing does that have on my life. I was merely commenting on the quaint idea of freedom."<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>At this point I should explain about Ohse. Ohse is a mouse, yousee. From when I first started living with and feeding her, I've talked to her about various topics as a means of distracting myself from the fact that I pamper her. Her current living arrangement is what visitors have referred to as Biosphere 3. A fish tank, complete with pump, that has various land masses and running water, which is itself inhabited by the various denizens (not of the Funk) of her little world: Fish-fish (a bottom feeder that keeps the slime under control), Orwell (a fu-fu beta fish that eliminates any parasites that find their way into the water<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a>), and Newt (a salamander that really doesn't do much but serve as a companion to Ohse<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a>). It wasn't until I placed some plants in Ohse's rectangle of influence that I learned she could talk. She began digging and ripping the plants apart while singing the Flight of the Valkeries...and rather well, I might add; she has a stunning baritone.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#167;</A></a><br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images1/1.1.gif"><br><dd>"That's a rather weighted way of describing freedom." I could tell she was itching for a fight by the way she'd stand still, then do a little jump and land facing the opposite direction. Mice aren't really big on the idea of looking people in the face when they're talking or being spoken to, which takes a while to get used to. "I take it you are talking in an abstract sense and not a legal sense."<br><dd>"Hey, what do I know about laws? The last time you told me about law was when that chick was thinking of suing for libel. Now pick me up for my exercises."<br> <dd>I stuck my palm down on the table and she clambered into it. Once safely in my hand I transported her to the open window where she promptly began climbing the screen. Prior to the time I had started jogging again, she didn't exercise. Soon afterward, however, I caught her running up and down the screen counting off her reps. She's very competitive.<br><dd>"The point," she said panting a little from the top of the screen, "is that the legal sense of freedom is little more than an extension of the philosophical concept. So in the end it doesn't matter what sense I mean.<br><dd>"But really, how free do you want to be? If you're like most monkeys, when you were a child, you wanted to be an adult so your parents couldn't tell you what to do. Now that you're an adult, there are laws protecting others from you, you from them, and even you from yourself. So are you free?"<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#165;</A><br><dd>"Wow, you're quite the little anarchist. I had no idea. And yes, I am free. Simply because there are laws prohibiting me from doing something doesn't mean I can't do them. I could go out right now and kill 23 people with an NRA approved semiautomatic hunting rifle just as easily as I could drive 17 miles over the speed limit. There's nothing stopping me from doing these things, just as there is nothing stopping others from punishing me for stepping outside societal norms."<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A><br><dd>"And driving 17 miles over the speed limit."<br><dd>"Right. No one really cares if I kill 23 people; it's a part of the culture now."<br><dd>"OK," Ohse said while climbing down the back of the couch to stand on my leg. It was raining outside and while climbing the screen a few times she had gotten a little wet, something that obviously didn't please her. "We're supposed to live in the freest country in the world, but if you head out to a secret military base, there's no way they'd let you in. They've obstructed your freedom."<br><dd>Hmmm. She had a point, but I wasn't going to let her win that easily. She obviously had a larger point to make but wanted to play Socrates for a while. Fine.<br><dd>"Well, you could argue that by allowing the present government to function the way it does the people in this country agree to certain limitations. Besides," I said suddenly remembering my Richard Bach," 'We're all free to do whatever it is we want to do.' They're free to stop me just as I'm free to enter that base. The apparent lack of freedom comes when two spheres of individual action overlap. Robinson Crusoe was ultimately free because there wasn't anyone there, until Friday, to cause a conflict of individual wills."<br><dd>I was feeling rather proud of myself on that one. I wasn't entirely sure if I believed all that, but it sounded good. There was still something that was missing, though....<br><dd>"So Mr. Crusoe was free. He could zip down to Kensington Gardens and pick up some Fish 'n Chips from a vendor any time he wanted, huh?"<br><dd>My stomach took on the distinct sinking feeling you get only when a rodent has gotten the upper hand. Ironically, it's the same feeling you get after having eaten too many fish and chips.  "What do you mean?"<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>"He was shipwrecked, you imbecile! It was physically impossible for the man to get anywhere in London, let alone fast food, because he was surrounded by water. He was in a cage and his freedom's were limited."<br><dd>At that moment I heard Giles burst into the kitchen from the basement. "Red Alert! We have a flood." he shouted as he came around the corner.<br><dd>"Oh, shit." I said as I got to my feet. Ohse, who had moved to the arm of the couch as Giles came into the room, was passed out.  Sometimes I wonder if she is narcoleptic In the middle of doing just about anything she'll suddenly fall asleep for a few moments, then wake up and go about her merry way...which usually consists of killing plants or terrorizing her aquatic friends by throwing rocks at them.<br><dd>I rushed into the basement with Giles and was hit by a wave that crashed against the stairs. It had been raining for three days and in back of the apartment a minor lake had formed. With all that water on the surface of the ground, the water table was so high that little streams were actually shooting out of the cinder block wall making it look like a nightmare dyke from Amsterdam (You know: a big butch lesbian that offers you lots of legal weed). Knowing the superb engineering that went into each and every one of RIT's buildings,<A NAME="8.8"><A HREF="#8">&#223;</A> everyone prepared for floods by suspending their belongings from the ceiling using ropes attached to pallets and hanging from overhead beams, reminiscent of an Incansic suspension bridge worker's nightmares.<br> <dd>Previously when we'd checked the basement, the sump-pump was working full time and kept everything under control. As we stood in the surf and looked at the pump, however, we could see that the water was being forced through the pipe into our basement. What was evidently happening was that the amount of water in the storm drains was so great that it had shorted out the sump-pump. That's what it looked like, anyway. All I knew was that the pump wasn't pumping and we were up to our shins in water.<br><dd>"Uh, I don't think we have enough fingers to plug all the holes."<A NAME="9.9"><A HREF="#9">&#149;</A><br><dd>Giles takes a hit from the helium balloon and squealed his agreement. "I'm gonna call physical plant," he said, running to the stairs.<br><dd>While Giles called the "professionals", I began to examine the pump. Just then there was a sudden gushing of water and a hum from next door.<br><dd>"Arr. Avast ye scurvy landlubber! Looks like the sump-pump from next door be pumpin' into your basement. Arr, har, har!"<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Looking down I saw a small raft of popsicle sticks held together with copper wire that I'd gotten from one of RIT's Neibleums.<A NAME="10.10"><A HREF="#10">&#176;</A><br><dd>"Holy shit, Ohse! Where'd you get the raft?"<br><dd>Giving a noncommittal shrug--which is really a trick for a mouse-- she said, "You think MacGyver is the only person who can make thermonuclear devices from old radium covered watch dials, duct tape, and Hubba-Bubba bubble gum? Paa-leze."<br><dd>She slowly made her way around me, making sure to stay clear of the water coming from the neighbor's pump. She was obviously right about the neighbor's pump: they were having the same problems as we were, and with our pump not working, the path of least resistance was right into our basement. Yeah!<br><dd>But what fascinated me was how Ohse's little pirate ship, complete with crude Jolly Roger ("Where did she get a pirate's flag," I wondered. "It looks like she used crayon's, but she couldn't possibly have held them easily." With my luck I'll find my crayon pack all chewed up and worn down into convenient mousy sized bits), was able to navigate. . . obviously under power.<br><dd>Forgetting the Deluge for a moment, I broke down and asked, "So Captain, what's powering your flagship?"<br><dd>"Oh, I put together a John Galt Self-generator and strapped it to the bottom."A little afraid that she might be telling the truth I picked up her raft. At the last instant she scrambled up my arm screaming, "You fucking monkey! You trying to plunge me into the drink?!"<br><dd>There, strapped to the bottom of the raft with more copper wire, was a very embarrassed looking Fish-fish. "She said she'd show me the world," he said as way of an explanation.<br><dd>Sighing, I very carefully placed the craft back into the water and Ohse re-boarded her slave galley. Deciding I'd had just about enough of Ohse and her antics, I started looking at the pump. It's one thing to deal with animals that talk to you on a regular basis, but when they insist on doing goofy things specifically to fuck with you, it is time to take stock in what your world is like. Right then all I wanted was a working pump.<br><dd>"So you kidnapped Fish-fish and made him a slave to power your little raft, huh? How'd you get him down the stairs? No, I don't want to know about that. Tell me how you're steering it though."<br><dd>I couldn't help but be interested. She was tooling about in the water obviously under power (<I>a la Fish-fish</I>), and with definite direction without an apparent rudder.<br><dd>With a smile Ohse pointed behind her with her head. "I've got an outboard Rebecca."<br><dd>A small black head looked up over the back of the raft and said, "My name's Newt. No one calls me Rebecca except my dorky brother."<br><dd>After a few moments of Ohse putting down the minor slave rebellion, which consisted mainly of trying to bite the top of Newt's head, she turned toward me. "I didn't come down here just to test out my boat. I want to continue our little discussion on freedom we were having earlier."<br><dd>"Hey Giles, what's the word from physical plant?" I hollered to stall. I needed just a few minutes to re-balance myself before getting into any real discussion with Ohse. It was one of her tactics in winning arguments to make people feel like they forgot which way blue smells.<br><dd>"Well," came a voice from the stairs and drawing closer, "the guy said we aren't the only ones, and that we're actually better off than most, and do you know your mouse is wearing an eye patch?"<br><dd>As far as I know, I'm the only one Ohse talks to, so it's no surprise that my room-mates don't know why I apparently do all sorts of odd things to her. Just another weapon she uses against me.<br><dd>"Yeah. She's a pirate mouse today. I'm gonna see if I can do anything with the pump."<br><dd>Giles gave me a sort of forced grin and waded back up the stairs.<br><center><IMG SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images1/1.4.gif"><br></center><dd>"OK. Freedom," I said while detaching the pump from it's pipe so I could remove it from its water filled pit. "You'd said that freedom was an illusion. Crusoe couldn't get fried food cause he was chilling on a beach in the middle of nowhere. As much as I hate to admit it, you've got a point. But his freedom has been limited by a physical universe acting on his physical body. It's not quite the same as someone refusing to sell him haddock and potatoes cause he had long hair and smelled like coconuts."<br><dd>I'd taken the pump and laid it out on the table. There was a thin stream of water that had flooded the top of the table, but as the pump was designed for submarine work, I didn't think it would hurt.<br><dd>"Ya might want to unplug that unless you like the idea of playing with electricity while standing in water," Ohse said off handedly. "In some ways Robby's lack of chips is worse than if someone were denying him the right to buy the chips. People change, see. Think about this country: women couldn't vote, now they can. Blacks were forced to use separate facilities from whites legally, and now they're just forced to do it socially."<A NAME="11.11"><A HREF="#11">&#42;</A><br><dd>"Stay on topic. No tangents into the socio-economic perpetuation of segregation or we'll be at it all night," I warned as I carried the dead serpentine cord of the pump to the table.<br><dd>"Right. Well, if you're in a cage, that's it. You're stuck. You and the people around you can change your world views as much as you want but you'll still be in a cage."<br><dd>"That all depends on what you think of as a cage, Ohse. Change your world view so you're satisfied with how things are and you have as much freedom as you want."<br><dd>I looked over at her and saw a smug smile on her little face. Shit! I'd just walked right into her argument.<br><dd>"Exactly. You have as much or as little freedom as you want. Take me, for instance: I'm a mouse and have a cage. It's a very nice cage, I might add, and you allow me an absurd amount of space to run around and climb on things, but it's still a cage. And to be honest, I wouldn't want to be one of those feral mousies. What have they got to look forward to? Wet when it rains, cold in the winter, and dead when death comes from on high. Why would I want that much freedom?"<br><dd> Newt stuck her face up over the edge of the raft and spoke in her lilting voice, "I remember that time I crawled out of the Brita water filter you put me in while cleaning the tank and got stuck in one of Kelly's hair balls.<A NAME="12.12"><A HREF="#12">&#248;</A> I can honestly say I didn't want all that freedom. Freedom sucks!"<br><dd>"Yeah, freedom sucks, monkey boy. And you, you little amphib, you'd better get back into the water and steer this crate or I'll give you more freedom than you've ever had. MOVE!<br><dd>"Grunts, you just have to know how to talk at them."<br><dd>Just then the smooth motion of her sleekly lined craft jolted. She was spiraling towards the cinder block monsoon as two little signs emerged from the water beside her craft and circled her in a hair-raising Jaws-like fashion.<br> <dd>The signs read, "The local 245 water engineers on strike!" and "Support your local union." A third, a latecomer, which was obviously not held by either Newt or Fish-fish and made me nervous to stand in the water, said  "Fungal infections to all slavers!" Ohse's smug expression disappeared from her furry little face the closer she got to the dreaded wall of water.<br><dd>"Ahh?" she managed almost inaudibly.<br><dd>Reaching down to her rescue I laughingly said, "Freedom sucks, huh Ohse?">br><dd>"Shut up and take us home."<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"><A NAME="8"><A NAME="9"><A NAME="10"><A NAME="11"><A NAME="12"></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> read as: Irish-Catholic and queer<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> Hanseatism is the worship of Hanson (capital `H' because they think they're an ethnic group) dressed in middle age costume at Tupperware parties.
