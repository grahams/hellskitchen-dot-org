Ultra-conservatives, ultra-liberals, ultra-politicals, distracted activists, Luddites, fratboys, the French, decency, the Christian Coalition (starring Ralph Reed as the Unholy Spawn of Our Lord Satan), portly bureaucrats, laughable hypocrites, holier-than-thou department store Santas. No problem.<br><dd>A useful strategy (and one that GDT has, itself, employed more than once) is to let your opponent do your work for you.  Frank Capra, director of such Hollywood classics as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "It's a Wonderful Life," produced a series of films just before World War II called "Why We Fight."  Under the guidance of the propagandist Office of War Information, Capra whipped the American movie-going public (which, at that time, was just about everyone) into a frenzy of depraved nationalism with footage from Germany, Italy and Japan ("...obtained secretly by the intelligent, athletic, and sexy boys over at the OWI...") accompanied by a patriotic voice-over and dramatic classical music.  Capra's technique was to throw some subtitled scenes of Hitler addressing the masses up on the screen, or Mussolini marching through Rome, or some Japanese children learning hand-to-hand combat.  After a few moments of silence (to let the audience absorb and begin to despise the new cultures), the narrator would pick up with some rhetoric about the fanaticism of the Axis and how they'd be on American shores soon, so give us all of your spare metal and rubber so we can dump them into the ocean just to make you feel good.  And we'll make explosives out of your cooking fat.<br><dd>But I digress.  The point is that Capra's genius lay in his ability to use his target's words for his own purposes.  Hitler gives a speech, the OWI translates it, Capra puts it in one of his films along with some "Look at how CRAZY these people are!" narration, and the American people take care of the rest.  Brilliant.<br><dd>Of course, the success of this negative spin doctoring depends on the availability of quotable material from the target; this can be a problem if your source is incapable of coherent thought (see "fratboys," "portly bureaucrats" above); it becomes downright frustrating when you're out to bash a large group without a convenient figurehead.<br><dd>This last is more common these days.  Often, the enemy is not a Reed, a Helms or a Gates.  We find ourselves staring down the gullets of animals much too broad to fit within our narrow fields of vision.  We are forced to walk the fine line between seeing the big picture and paranoid theorizing.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><B><center><font size = +1>The Power of (Exploiting) the Individual</B></font size><p></center></td></tr></table><table width = 500><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd> It is here that we must personalize.  We must bring the story down to the audience's level.  If the piece is on teenage drinking, constrict the focus to the exploits of a single kid over the course of one weekend.  If the piece concerns mistreatment of the elderly, go mistreat the elderly and interview them afterward.  If the piece mentions lesbian sex, go engage in or observe lesbian sex.  You get the idea.<br><dd>Mike Barnicle, a Boston Globe columnist for over 25 years, falls into this mode almost every week.  Barnicle has long been celebrated as a champion of the working man, a warm humanist with an eye for subtlety, and the only Globe columnist who ever pays any attention to the city of Boston.  The technique that earned him this respect and admiration is the heart of personalization in journalism.  Here's a sample:<br>  <dd>      "Mario Tawfiq was born Mario Corleone Fusilli on a boat to Ellis Island in 1914.  After Mario was delivered, his mother, widowed after his father was killed in the Naples Sambuca Riots of 1913, returned immediately to prostitution and gambling aboard the ship, the U.S.S. Dysentery.  Mario was left to be tortured by the ship's crew, all of whom had bad cases of halitosis.<br> <dd> "Mario moved to Boston in 1934, during the Great Depression.  He became involved in a small-time ring of thugs smuggling crack-cocaine from Canada.<br>        <dd>"It was there he met "Lucky" Lucy Ricardo."<br><dd>And so forth.  By the end of the column, the reader is convinced that Mario's story proves the tenacity of the human spirit, the inner strength we find despite harrowing odds, and the inefficiency and futility of the welfare system.<br><dd>Boston Magazine attempted to track down some of Barnicle's Everyman characters, and were unsuccessful on many counts.  This led them to the conclusion that a lot of Barnicle's work is a good story, but a big lie. (Barnicle denied the allegations, calling Boston Magazine a bunch of people who "sit in cubicles all day and put out a hotel guide."

She was a great student, a genius thinker, a talented musician, and a fun person to be with.<br><dd>The second is a junior.  He is a flaming racist, misogynist, homophobe, and acquaintance rapist who cheated his way through high school.  I once overheard him boasting about a New Year's Eve party, where he had gotten some girl nice and beshitted, then taken sexual advantage of her once she was too drunk to care.  That year, he was named Citizen of the Year by the local newspaper.  Why?  Because he plays soccer.<br><dd>The third was accepted on a football scholarship.  During a break from school last year, he and some friends (all residents of the town that I live in) beat another young man comatose.<br><dd>Conclusion: Two out of three Yale students belong in Hell.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><B><center><font size = +1>Asshole Phenomena Plus a Checklist for a More Well-Defined Personality</B></font size><p></center></td></tr></table><table width = 500><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd> If you tell him he's smart, he'll believe you.  If you tell him he's talented, he'll believe you.  If you tell him he's gifted, he will most certainly believe you.<br><dd>Inevitably, he will develop warped standards of measurement in an attempt to quantify intelligence, talent, or beauty.  He will think to himself, "I know more words than that guy."  Or, "My grade point average is higher than his." Or, "Chicks dig me."  He will tailor standards of achievement, customized to match his present skill.<br><dd>He will find distractions - he will define himself through categorization. He will proudly proclaim, "I'm smarter than 99.9% of you, and I'm gay."  He will miss the point by a wide fucking margin.<br><dd>Here is a checklist for a more well-defined personality.  Try it at home.<br>1.) Generalize.<br> 2.) Narrow the scope of your record collection.<br> 3.) Use cultural "catch phrases": da bomb, mad props, ill<br> 4.) Carry props - bags, hats, belts, knives 5.) Self-mutilation - tattooing, piercing<br> 6.) Hone arguments on binary issues - abortion, welfare, financial aid, vegetarianism<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/shirkn.html"> Other Shirk'n'Shouts in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/et.html">Eric Thomas</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
