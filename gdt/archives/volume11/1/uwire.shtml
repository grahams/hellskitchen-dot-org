For many of us they pass through our memories just as quickly as they come, like ghost ships in the night.<br><dd><font color=red><I>I dig. I miss those ghost ships all the time. It must be great in Nebraska, watching the ghosts ships sail on the amber waves of grain.</I><br></font color><dd>It has escalated beyond the point of our dismissing this pattern with a mere shaking of the head and mumbling of "It's a shame."<br><dd><font color=red><I>With a shake of the fist: "Those goddamn kids!"</I></font color><br><dd>It is turning into an epidemic.<br><dd><i><font color=red>Yes, like the Bubonic Plague or AIDS.</I><br></font color><dd>The virus of violence continues to spread with a recent confrontation coming in Chicago, with the death of Ryan Harris, an 11-year-old girl.<br> <dd><font color=red><I>And the confrontation is?</I><br></font color><dd>"That's a shame, too," we might say or think, but tragedy doesn't begin to scrape the surface of this latest outbreak of child hostility.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Okay...somebody needs to connect the words "shame," "tragedy," and "scrape" for me.  Remember, the average American reads at a sixth-grade level.<br></I></font color><dd>The accused, a phrase we usually associate with the likes of serial killers played by John Malkovich or Kevin Spacey in movies, are two boys - ages 7 and 8.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Those boys were 2 degrees from Kevin. Face it, the kids don't mean as much as the President blowing his load all over some intern's dress.<br></I></font color> <dd>What would it take for two boys, barely beyond diapers, to beat another child to death?<br><dd><font color=red><I>All of those diapers must be rough on elementary school septic systems. 7 is awful late for diapers. What's up with Nebraska?</I><br></font color><dd>This question gets at the center of what is causing youth all over the country to take the lives of their peers. <font color=red><I>[Stinky diapers]</I></font color> What makes the difference between a child deciding that killing is more "stimulating" than watching Sesame Street or playing Nintendo and any other child?<br><dd><I><font color=red>Gun training instead of potty training.<br></I></font color><dd>That is not a question or problem we like to think about, <font color=red><I>[What question?  Get out your Warriner's, `cause that's a weak reference. ]</I></font color> but it is one that has to be answered and rectified. Otherwise, Associated Press headlines may soon originate in Lincoln or another town<font color=red> <I>[AP doesn't cover Nebraska?]</I></font color>, which immediately would prompt us to call family, praying that it wasn't our relatives who were victims of another shooting spree.<br><dd><I><font color=red>Or praying our relatives weren't the perps. "Oh my God, Helen, did little John tweak today?"<br></I></font color><dd>Is this realistic? I don't think we want to find out the hard way.<br><dd><I><font color=red>Is what realistic? The AP covering Nebraska? No, they cover states that can read and write.<br></I></font color><dd>The rippling effects of shooting sprees may never be fully realized by the family and friends of those who have fallen victim to internal battles with common sense and fantasy.<br><dd><font color=red><I>So what your saying is the families of the young brothers who have fallen in the good fight have not died in vain, but have instead served to perpetuate the dual tropes of gang violence in Nebraska and run-on sentences.<br></I></font color><dd>After being convicted of the Jonesboro shootings, Mitchell Johnson (now 14) and Andrew Golden (now 12) were sentenced to the custody of juvenile authorities, where they could remain until age 21 or longer.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Were they in camouflage diapers when they earned their stripes?<br></I></font color><dd>Under Arkansas' current legal system, they could be released by age 18 - something the families of the victims have a hard time dealing with.<br><dd><font color=red><I>No shit. My kid gets blown away and the killers walk at 18. Not read, walk.<br></I></font color><dd>On May 21, Kipland P. Kinkel decided it might be "cool" to go on a shooting rampage of his own, and authorities say he started with his mother and father, both found dead later that day. Next, he proceeded to shoot and kill a classmate and injure 23 others at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore.<br><dd><font color=red><I>The problem was that Mom and Dad didn't pack the FlufferNutter&#153; before he capped them.<br></I></font color><dd>What baffles most people, beyond the brutal assault at the high school, is the fact that Springfield police had to send in a bomb squad to defuse the house before they could even search it or bring out the bodies of his parents.<br><dd><font color=red><I>This kid has mad skills. Booby traps? Remember "Goonies?"<br></I></font color><dd>Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse - it did.<br><dd>If we shift our focus momentarily from these childhood horror stories in America, we need not look far to other recent outbreaks of violence toward children of the world.<br><dd><font color=red><I>What did? What's worse? Did Timmy fall down the well? What happened?<br></I></font color><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images1/uwire.gif"><br><dd>Richard, Mark, and Jason Quinn, ages 11, 9 and 8 respectively, lost their lives in Northern Ireland in early July during a firebombing of their house. The bombing was the result of hateful attitudes geared toward the Quinns' Catholic mother because she was living with a Protestant companion.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Ireland is far from Nebraska. Obviously geography is another failing element of the Nebraskan education. Perhaps we should be more worried about Nebraska's affect on children.</I><br></font color><dd>If you are expecting further explanation as to why this happened, beyond the long-standing unrest in Northern Ireland, you won't find any. Someone decided that the message their r mother was sending to the community crossed unspeakable religious barriers and "accidentally" killed three of her sons, leaving their brother, Lee, an only child.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Do we need more explanation than the long standing unrest in Ireland? Does the IRA?</I><br></font color><dd>Many residents of the Quinns' community still feel it was a justified attack.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Maybe the Quinns were assholes?<br></I></font color><dd>In Sierra Leone, a land recently plagued by civil war, there is disagreement as to who has more power, the government or the rebels.<br><dd><font color=red><I>TRANSITIONS? DID TIMMY FALL DOWN THE WELL?<br></I></font color><dd>A group of rebels loyal to the ousted military regime are warring against a Nigerian-led West African intervention force. They tear through the country and carry out random acts of violence just to spite President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Meanwhile, back in Nebraska...</I><br></font color><dd>Children are beaten, disfigured, raped and killed because a group of people think that is the way to power. Too many pictures have surfaced in the media depicting children with fingers sliced partially or fully off, hands missing or slashed faces.<br><dd><font color=red><I>It happens to everyone. Builds character. Scars are good when trying to  pick up girls. And you know what they say about men with no hands.<br></I></font color> <dd>Here, the only hope we have is to raise children that don't look to Beavis and Butthead for moral guidance and don't take peer influence as superior instruction to parental authority.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Beavis and Butthead told me to hate Bon Jovi. Words of wisdom.<br></I></font color><dd>Then we have another issue: the parents.<br><dd>How many alcoholic, drug-infested parents with gambling, abusive and other tendencies can we have before we will begin to see truly irreversible patterns of behavior and violence against children in more communities than we already have?<br><dd><font color=red><I>Drug infested?  Is that like rat infested?  And he still hasn't told us if Timmy fell down the well!<br></I></font color><dd>Someone or something needs to change. Who's it going to be? Parents? Children? The media? Simple.<br><dd>Everyone.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Pick one.  Make sure to fill in your circle completely. And by the way, the Blues Brothers say that EVERYBODY needs somebody.  They must be from Nebraska<br></I></font color><dd>I want to see newspapers printing big, front-page stories and headlines when a third-grader gets an "A" on a test. Forget the lure of violence and mayhem on the front page.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Did they even HAVE 'A's in third grade?  And wouldn't these headlines crowd out really important things like shootings and Presidential "little messes"?<br></I></font color><dd>Show me a child learning how to write in cursive or hitting a home run in Little League.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Show me a child learning how to write in Nebraska, and I'll show you a future victim of a grain silo accident.  "Little Will should have paid more attention when I was learnin' him, 'stead of writin' all the time."<br></I></font color><dd>I want to see parents praising their kids more in public. Enough of the excessive disciplining of children in front of others.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Sometimes I want to discipline other people's children in front of others. Preferably their parents.<br></I></font color><dd>Treat kids better than strangers, not the other way around.<br><dd><font color=red><I>I thought we were supposed to be nice to everybody?  If they treat strangers better than kids, what do you think they do to black people in Nebraska?<br></I></font color><dd>Parents need to pay more attention to and spend more time with their children. Some studies have suggested that quality family time is decreasing rapidly in the average American household.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Quality family time in our household started to decline when Mom started drinking and Dad had to work two shift in the mill to keep all of us in diapers.<br></I></font color><dd>Give kids more books to read, unplug the Nintendo three days out of the week and take kids to the park or beach rather than the arcade.<br><dd>Show them how to use the Internet as an educational resource and not as a television supplement. Otherwise we will see the birth of Generation Zombie.<br><dd><font color=red><I>And now, the children of ROB ZOMBIE!  Those kids will be 'more human than human.'<br></I></font color><dd>With all this violence and tragedy, it would seem hard at times to find hope in those we look toward to become our future politicians, doctors, secretaries and esteemed burger-flippers. But what's done is done. Be thankful for what the departed have taught us and don't let the memories of them be in vain.<br><dd><font color=red><I>This closet caste system we've got really kicks ass, don't you think, Karl?<br></I></font color><dd>Cooper's Law: You can't change the past, but you can prevent it from consuming the future.<br><dd><font color=red><I>That must be a damn hungry future.<br></I></font color><dd>So what can children do? Nothing by themselves, and that is we come in. Give kids good things to emulate and they just might turn to good deeds instead of bad ones.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Children are empty vessels, 'that is we come in.'  Huh?  I say stuff those kids with lovin' from the oven.  I bet Albert Einstein's mom told him the whole theory of relativity over a nice plate of sauerbraten.<br></I></font color><dd>Children have a right to their innocence.<br><dd>Give it back to them.<br><dd><font color=red><I>Is that his closing?  I'm sorry.<br></I></font color>                                  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size=+1>The Offenders</font size><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/af.html">Adam Fletcher</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/gfh.html">Giles Francis Hall</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/jph.html">Jeremiah Perry-Hill</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/ct.html">Clare Terni</A><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
