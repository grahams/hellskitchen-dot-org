This is unprofessional."<br><dd>It was a typical Friday afternoon at the Reporter office, a place I had started to regard as a sort of home. Since it was the first meeting of the year, the editors had been asked to say a few words about each of their sections. I was all too familiar with David, the sports editor. I had quickly learned that he was a man to whom the phrase "I don't write sports" is completely alien, and subsequently avoided him at every interval. I expected him to highlight the main points involved in sportswriting at RIT.  Instead, everyone present was treated to his brief diatribe against the free expression embodied in Hell's Kitchen.<br><dd>All I could really do was blink. Whenever I hear someone say something that's clearly wrong, I can't help but replay it in my head a few times until I'm absolutely sure that that's what they really meant to say. Case in point: my entire Marriage class in high school thought they heard the teacher say he would slug his daughter's hypothetical boyfriend "if she came home with a black guy". He had said "with a black eye", of course.<br> <dd>Sometimes a few moments of clarification can make all the difference.<br><dd>In light of that, I dissected what David had said. "Unprofessional"? Of course Hell's Kitchen doesn't pay its writers...but I don't imagine that's what he meant. Professional-ism, I suppose, involves carefully censoring your personal feelings from everything you write. There's nothing wrong with that; it's called newswriting. He just shouldn't have said "it's unprofessional" when he meant "its newswriting isn't as hardcore as ours".<br><dd>As for whether anyone wanted to write for Hell's Kitchen, I hardly feel David was qualified to make that judgement for so many people at one time.<br> <dd>Trying to compare the Reporter and Hell's Kitchen is like comparing apples and oranges; the former is a news magazine, the latter is a creative outlet. One is blessed with donated paper, a paid staff, and high production values, and the other makes up for the lack of same through sheer heart alone.<br> <dd>Steve,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> another editor, quickly tried to smooth things over for the new blood. "Hell's Kitchen is another publication on campus, kids. We've sort of always had this rivalry."  This is where it all fell apart for me. From indiscriminate bigotry to meaningless old rivalries, it all had to go. It was all wrong.<br><dd>See, I've always been cursed with an unhealthy dose of idealism. I love the written word; it's the closest thing I've ever had to a religion. In committing myself to taking as many opportunities as possible to practice and improve my craft, I was undoubtedly being naive when I tried to work for two vastly different publications.<br> <dd>No matter your ideals, it's impossible to live in a world untouched by people picking the scabs of disputes so old that all of the original players have packed up and gone home. There are always going to be people with a sick need to instigate conflict.<br> <dd>Not only do I fail to comprehend the notion of war for tradition's sake: I defy it. <br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> Names have been changed.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/jph.html">Jeremiah Parry-Hill</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
