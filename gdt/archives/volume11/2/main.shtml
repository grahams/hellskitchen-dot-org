No mistake. Christians don't really want you to find outwhat became of God. By the time the Koran was being written, God was starting to get a bit wiggy.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> Now-a-days, Heaven is like an assisted living environment for God.<br> <dd>Kind of makes you want to go out and do a little carnal sinning&#153;, huh?<br><dd>Sure, God is still writing books, (Kids: Stephen King!) but few ever believe them. Here's an example that one of the field agents for a subsidiary of Hell Inc.  managed to pick up while visiting Baltimore, Maryland:<p><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images2/1.1.gif"><center><font size=+1><B>The Book of Haim Meshuggina</B></font size></center><p>1. And lo, this is the WORD and RANTING of the LORD, for He is old and cranky and often forgets the point of his stories.<br>2. In the beginning there was nothing, for the LORD was a true neat freak and ran a tight ship.<br>3. But then He got BORED and so He made friends who came over and slobbed the place about.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a><br>4. And the mess DID become the universe and all the stars, and the waters were the spilled drinks.<br>5. For Bounty&#153; can not expunge fifty billion year old stains from the polyester fabric of the multiverse.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a><br> 6. So sayeth the LORD: You youngins are just spoiled WITH all your suns and planets and organized matter. Why I remember a time when I could be entertained for hours by just watching quarks and baryons.<br>7. We didn't have TV or radio. All we had was electromagnetic waves. We'd sit and listen to static for hours on end. And we enjoyed it. It's amazing the content you get out of nothing.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a><br>8. Back in my day, we didn't have schools. We had to go outside and MAKE the laws of nature. And let me tell you, that's a lot harder. All we had was hydrogen,<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#167;</A></a> and you don't know how that mucks up your complexion.<br>9. And that Mary Magdalene. Wow, what a looker she was. She was so flexible. I remember one time out behind the temple with Mary, Mary, quite contrary...but once I told her who I was she started having fun... we even invented something new<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#165;</A></a>... now what was that called?<br>10. And the angel Gabriel did smile and patronize the LORD saying: "Ah, God, that never happened."<br>11. "What are you talking about?" snappeth the LORD. I'm God, if I said it happened, it happened. You youngins don't know how to respect your Creators anymore.<br>12. You... you creatures of the universe take LIGHT for granted. Well I came up with that all by myself, it was easy. I created everything. Why I came up with WAR and thought it was a DAMN fine idea, by Me.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images2/1.2.gif"><br>13. But I want to tell you the story about the last time I saw Lucifer. It was shortly after I'd gone and made a garden for Adam and Uh, what's her name. Not Eve, but his first wife.... You know, the one with the great ass. You know, SARAH McLachlan. Back when Adam still had his whatsit.<br> 14. Anyway, I was so pleased with how everything had turned out that I invited all of the angels to a dinner party. There were chips and pickles and all kinds of new stuff I'd created. Deep fat frying was going over pretty well.<br> 15. Well, here comes Lucifer, and he was always such a brown-noser. Always had to wear his wings the same way I did and his PANTS half-way down his ass. Anyway, he had gone out and tried to make something on his own to give to me and Adam and whatshername. I don't remember exactly what it was supposed to do, but it was this huge shiny copper thingy with all these moving parts.<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A></a><br>16. He was so excited about showing it off that he wasn't paying attention to where he was going and tripped. Well, that there THINGY went up into the air just as pretty as can be. Everyone stopped talking and watched as this monstrous contraption flew over their heads.<A NAME="8.8"><A HREF="#8">&#223;</A></a><br>17. And poor Lucifer was sprawled out on the ground, his mouth OPEN, just looking on in horror. Finally it hit the railing of the balcony overlooking the multiverse and the whole thing tipped over the side, spilling all the glinty things out into the vacuum of space.<br> 18. They spread out just as pretty as could be, making this band of glinty LIGHTS in the universe that Man calls the Milky Way.<A NAME="9.9"><A HREF="#9">&#149;</A></a>Well, at the time, no one knew what to say, except Michael,<A NAME="10.10"><A HREF="#10">&#176;</A></a> who was always the joker.<br>19. Way to go, light bringer.<br>20. Well everyone started laughing at that and Lucifer was so embarrassed, he ran out of the hall. I haven't seen him since that night, but I hear he's doing rather well for himself, though he's a little preoccupied with things he's calling GOOD and EVIL and something connected called sin. I think it's a kind of engine, but I don't know.<br>21. Did I ever tell you about the time I won the World Series?<br>22. And lo, the great angel of the LORD did rise up and say, "Ahh LORD it is time for your medication"<br>23. And the angel Gabriel did present a holy waxy-white bullet to the LORD. And the LORD did excuse himself and Gabriel to the convenience of the bathroom.<A NAME="11.11"><A HREF="#11">&#42;</A></a><br>24. And from within that sacred room, the LORD's great suffering was heard, "Ow, my ass!"<br>  </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"><A NAME="8"><A NAME="9"><A NAME="10"><A NAME="11"></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> Nahnana nah na na...<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> And lo, the LORD created fraternity brothers and kegs of cheap domestic beer.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#135;</A> Nor can any other home remedy: seltzer water, hairspray, Michael Collins, or John Waters.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#164;</A> Such as that quality network programming, TGIF&#153;.<BR><A HREF="#5.5">&#167;</A> "Oh, the humanity"<BR><A HREF="#6.6">&#165;</A> Our overqualified staff religion experts disagree about exactly what God is referring to here.
