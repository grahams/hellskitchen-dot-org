The young punks didn't notice John and I enter.<br><dd>"Me and Dave used to chase that kid around the skate park all day, trying to get him to lift up his shirt so we could see his fuckin' tits.  Two months, we did that.  And he never did it. He just said, 'No!'" - a high falsetto, meant to sound effeminate - "and ran away.  I respect that kid for that."  The kid in the Guttermouth T-shirt was almost screaming, and punctuated his sentences by pointing at the others.<br><dd>Billy, who was sprawled across the couch with his hat on sideways and a Red Stripe in his hand, came to life.  "He has a Sellouts patch on his fuckin' jacket!  What kinda..."<br><dd>Guttermouth cut him off.  "He's just fuckin' fat..."<br><dd>Billy cut Guttermouth off.  "Fat doesn't mean anything, but that patch..."<br><dd>I cut Billy off.  "It doesn't matter that he's fat, but because he has  one patch on his jacket, he's a big asshole."<br><dd>Billy, suddenly noticing me, and then John, was dumbfounded for a second. He sat up from the couch, spread his arms wide, and karate-chopped at me with both hands (one hand dangerously close to spilling 'The Taste of Jamaica' on the carpet) as he spoke.<br><dd>"Brian Brimmer!"  He looked at me, then at John, then back at me, waiting for some sign of recognition.  "Brian Brimmer!"<br><dd>John, in a loud, whiny voice: "Oh, yeah!  I saw him on the cover of Loser Magazine!"<br><dd>Me, following suit: "No, it was Fatboy Loser magazine!"  We both started to laugh.  "Fatboy Loser With A Sellouts Patch What An Asshole Magazine!"<br><dd>John and I walked out to the porch.  The commotion over Brian Brimmer had calmed.  Soft-core porn was showing on Showtime, and the punks were yelling at the television.<br><dd>"The funny thing about the situation in there is that they're all making fun of the porno, but all the guys..."<br><dd>John finished for me.  "...are holding their beers over their crotches?"<p>November, 1997<br> <dd>"Eric, this is Jeremy.  He used to live down the hall from me."<br><dd>We shook hands.  Jeremy had to switch his flask of Captain Morgan into his other hand.<br><dd>They started talking about Jeremy's roommate from the year before.  I got bored.  "Hey, Max!  I'm going outside for a smoke."<br><dd>Usually, at a party like that one, I'll go outside to have a cigarette, even if everyone else is smoking inside.  I need frequent breaks from bad dance music and loud boys with identical wardrobes and too much grease in their hair.<br><dd>Max and Jeremy followed me outside.  Max asked me for a smoke; Jeremy kept talking.<br><dd>"...so you know where it's at, man.  You wanna know what I'm gonna do for a job?"<br><dd>"What, man?"  Max had a Heineken in his hand and a big smile on his face."I'm gonna be a fuckin' lawyer, and I'm gonna steal money from old people."<br><dd>Max laughed.<br><dd>"'Cause you can fuck shit up when you're a lawyer, man.  I'm gonna get what's mine.  I got a lot comin' to me, too, the shit I been through."<br><dd>I was interested.  "What shit have you been through?"<br><dd>"I'm not your average college kid, mommy and daddy takin' care of everything.  My mom and dad don't give me shit.  I gotta survive."<br><dd>"That's great, but what sort of shit have you been through?"<br><dd>"I don't think I have to talk about that with you, man."  He was getting angry.  I think my questions were too hard for him.  I shut up.<br><dd>Jeremy turned back to Max.  "Yo, you remember we used to roll up mad blunts in my room?  Just sittin' there with a blunt and a fuckin'...  forty of O.E. with the TV on.  There is so much CUNT at this party!"  Back to me. "Yo, you gonna hit any of this cunt tonight?"<br><dd>I answered slowly.  "No."<br><dd>To Max.  "Who the fuck is this kid?"  To me.  "Look around you.  Look at all the pussy at this...  fuckin'... party.  You're telling me you're not out for cunt tonight?"<br><dd>Again, slowly.  "No, I am not out for cunt tonight."<br><dd>To Max.  "Yo, this kid's a fuckin' limpwrist, man.  I gotta piss.  Gimme one of your beers, man.  There is so much CUNT here..."<br><dd>Max was still laughing when Jeremy walked away.  He looked at me.  "You just gotta take Jeremy for what he is, man.  He's an asshole, but he's a good kid."<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><B><center><font size = +1>Notes on Yearbook Superlatives</B></font size><p></center></td></tr></table><table width = 500><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd> Next time you meet the handsome, athletic, red-blooded American boy that won "Best All-Around," tell him you're not surprised because you always knew he'd make an excellent gymnast.<br><dd>The "Best Eyes" winners always look demonic.<br> <dd>I once wasted ten minutes conversing with the "Most Intellectual" from the year after I graduated.  We were at a party.  He was drunk.<br><dd>"...so one of those hippie chicks asked me to host a room for the Round Robin.  And I was like, 'Whatever.'  So we had, like, vodka and cranberry juice or somethin'...  And me and Frank were up there makin' drinks, and Frank had some... uh, you know Ritalin?"<br><dd>"Yeah.  Methylphenidate.  Stimulant.  Usually prescribed for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, but also for obesity and narcolepsy."<br><dd>"Yeah, yeah...  so Frank had some Ritties in, like, a cigarette pack. And we were just doin' that shit up, you know...<br><dd>"It's also used as a recreational drug when crushed and snorted."<br><dd>"And somebody's poundin' on the door.  So I get up and open it, and it's the fuckin' cops, man.  Everybody freaks.  Half the people in the room just got up and ran out and me and Frank were just standing there, and Frank gets up to talk and fuckin' dumps the Ritalin all over the floor.  And the cops ask what it is and he tells 'em 'Ritalin' and he's supposed to take it for ADD.  They ask us if we've been drinkin' and we tell 'em 'No' and they tell us they're not gonna bust our balls for partying 'cause they did the same thing and we should try to keep it down 'cause it's three o'clock in the morning.  That was _fucked_ up.  Were you at that Round Robin?"<br><dd>"No.  Round Robins in Baker usually come down to one girl with a wad of money asking everyone if they've paid."<br><dd>"Do you know Vicki?"<br><dd>"Yeah, Vicki and I go way back.  I met her at the beginning of my freshman year."<br><dd>"Is it just me, or is she the hottest black girl you've ever seen?"<br><dd>"Vicki's beautiful, yes."<br><dd>"I mean, I've never been hot for a black girl before.  Vicki turned me around."<br><dd>"How wonderful for you."<br><dd>Your challenge: guess which of the speakers was me, and which was "Most Intellectual."<br><dd>I'm not saying I deserve any awards.  I just think saying (in all honesty) that a girl of another race "turned you around" is not the mark of an intellectual.<br> <dd>Only vote for a "Class Couple" if you want to break up a relationship.<br><dd> I had the dubious honor of being voted "Most Sassy" (read as: "What an Asshole") for my High School yearbook.  My female counterpart was a heartless wench with venomous eyes and a steel vagina.<br><dd>I was absent for my coronation at the school's annual Pep Rally - my sassy self was skipping class to smoke cigarettes at a doughnut shop.<p> Suggested Superlatives:<p> <UL><LI>Most Likely To Have "Needed The Money"<LI>Class Curmudgeon<LI>Braless Wonder/Sweatpants King<LI>Most Likely To Be Dull<LI>Easiest/Sleaziest<LI>Doomed Couple<LI>Closet Dyke/Closet Fag<LI>Miss/Mister Scatology<LI>Spineless Toady<li>Most Likely To Kill The Yearbook Committee</UL><p><dd>Amputees should get severance pay.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/shirkn.html"> Other Shirk'n'Shouts in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/et.html">Eric Thomas</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
