You know him.  He's the antithesis of Julia Child and Martha Steward, providing recipes that sometimes have as few as two ingredients. One fine example that comes to mind is Chex Mix coated with a mixture of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Seasonings and butter, put in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit for 15 minutes and "Ooh, it's sooo good!"&#153;.  Another is the Super Bowl meal special where he showed viewers how to make a Turkey Sub.<br><dd>Over the years, due to my income bracket and lack of appropriate food prepreation time, I have discovered similar "recipes."  However, I prefer to call them tricks to spice up boring everyday cheap food.<br><dd>Now, like Mr. Food, I have a short, descriptive title and a catchy tag line to let the viewers (in this case the readers) know that the segment is over...<br><dd>This first recipe is going to be the most complex one I will EVER present.  I call it Tuna fish Spread.<br>  <dd>Italics indicate ingredient is optional, but keep in mind: the more you use, the better it'll taste.<p><UL><LI>2 cans of tuna<LI>Mayonnaise<LI><I>Ranch or Italian Dressing (to taste)<LI>Goya Hot Sauce or Tabasco Sauce<LI>1/2 cup chopped peppers (any  variety)<LI>1/4 - 1/2 a chopped tomato<LI>1/4 cup chopped onion<LI>1/4 cup Celery<LI>1/8 cup grated orange rind<LI>2 Tablespoons of Sour Cream or Yogurt (Plain, Lemon, Peach, Raspberry work)<LI>2 Tablespoons Ketchup<LI>2 Tablespoons of Sweet Relish<LI>1 Tablespoon of Lemon Juice<LI>2 Teaspoons Dill Weed<LI>2 Teaspoons Oregano<LI>2 Teaspoons Paprika<LI>2 Teaspoons Garlic Powder (or 1 actual garlic clove)<LI>A Dash of black pepper<LI>1/2 A Clove Cigarette (filter and paper removed)<li>Burgundy Wine (to taste)</I></UL><p><dd>Dump the tuna in a bowl.  Add whatever optional ingredients you can.  Slowly mix in Mayonnaise until you reach a pleasant consistency and this could be used for a sandwich or mixed in with any type of noodle.<br><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/snack.html"> Other Sir Snacks in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
