Given the fact that I've been walking bare-foot for approximately ten years, how pretty do you think my feet could be? Just imagine all the times I must have walked over broken glass which then got lodged in my heel leaving me to perform minor surgery with an unsterile scapel. In the end the soles of my feet look more like the suface of the moon with major asteroid damage. Then just think of all the times my backalley surgical equipment led to big pus-oozing infections. Finally I want you to think about all of those cold harsh New York winters. Toes falling off left and right. I always have to have a tube of Krazy-Glue handy in case of emergency. I remember the one time I didn't; I was forced to use a hot glue gun. I still have those little glue strings trailing off in every direction like some kind of deranged foot decoration. What do you think I'm going to say?<br><dd>"...Sure I'll send you pictures of my feet."<br><dd>Why, so I can feed every foot fetish within a one hundered mile radius? What is it with people taking pictures of their feet?<br><dd>If you want some kind of thrill, take off your shoes and socks and take a picture of your own feet. Send it to yourself in the mail; it will be like Christmas, honest. WHATEVER you do, and this is the really important part, DON'T, and I mean don't, send them to me. Believe me, I've had enough people send me pictures of their feet for inexplicable reasons along with questions asking how they make me feel.  Ah, let me see...uncomfortable? There are only so many things you can do with pictures of other people's feet.<br><dd>It is a given that I will answer any question sent to me, maybe not correctly or how the person had planned, but answered to some degree or another. But please send me something interesting, for a change.<br><dd>-the Bare-foot Girl<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
