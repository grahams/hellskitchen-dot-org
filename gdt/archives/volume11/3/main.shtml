If I go into a WalMart, bolts of lightning will strike me dead."<br><dd>"No way!"<br><dd>"I'll stay in the car." (Vague, pet-like panting.)<br><dd>"Get OUT of the car."<br><dd>"No."<br><dd>"Yes"<br><dd>"You're so pushy.  I'm out, I'm out.  Let's go."<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images3/1.1.gif"><br><dd>And so my sick fascination with WalMart began.  At first, I clung to the natural sunlight found only at the entrance.  The initial Aisle of Special Buys was too much for me.  I craved the occasional bursts of air from the automatic doors, higher prices, and the knowledge that I wasn't screwing over small businesses. Elderly women with names like Ethel, Maude, and Fanny eyed me suspiciously while their wizened claws clutched receipts  for oversized items.  I remained Virtue Incarnate!  Friends loped through the cash registers bearing every conceivable personal care product, in addition to housewares whose prices were admittedly below those of other stores, but I remained immune.  My twelve-dollar knives were better than their nine-dollar knives simply because they hadn't come from WalMart.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> My sixty-cent candy bars were superior to their fifty-cent candy bars because they came from the guy in the 'hood who sells forties<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> to underage-kids.  My purchase habits were helping to forge a brave new world, free of the scourge of the Big Blue W.<br><dd>Until I needed a roll of Scotch Wall-Saver tape.<br><dd>The Scotch Company, a division of 3M, worked a miracle with WallSaver.  The adhesive membrane dispenses like double-stick tape, but is easily removed from walls and paper by rubbing, much like rubber cement.  As an added bonus, you can use it to fake truly revolting skin rashes, as its pasty-white colour screams "sun blisters" and its flexibility is truly astounding.  Mind you, I had not been squandering the roll of tape I had located in my hometown stationery store.  You can only get your new housemate so many times with "OH GOD WHAT IS THAT THING GROWING ON MY ARM?!" Instead, I had been carefully constructing a Hanson-style shrine to Jim Dine, a California painter and engraver.  Then of course, all of those pictures of drunken naked people came back from CVS and I had to prominently display them.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a><br><dd>Pictures of your friend's lust object adorned in nothing but your British flag apron may be amusing, but don't merit framing.  Wall-Saver was the obvious weapon of choice.  Again, Mr. Dine is a fairly prolific man, so I was out of tape.<br><dd>Me: Damn! I don't have anymore Wall-Saver.<br><dd>Housemate: You could get that at WalMart.<br><dd>Me: Dude,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a>  my dad would kill me.  You can't tell anybody.<br><dd>I should explain about my housemate.  Kristen is a very nice person, a conscientious kitchen cleaner and a Saturn-driver.  However, she did grow up in central New York, land of the religious freaks<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a>  and WalMart monopoly.  I  like to think that a good excuse for my reaction to WalMart is "We didn't have them where I grew up."  We didn't have a lot of things where I grew up...Twinkies, running water... the point here being that where I grew up there were no WalMarts; where Kristen grew up, there were no small businesses.<br><dd>WalMart did try to bring me into the fold earlier.  I spent eighteen idyllic years running around in rural eastern New York, summer home to New York City denizens and Timothy Leary before he was welcomed to the Hotel California.  Would Tim Leary have lived in a place that sucked?  I think not.  We had diners and "mom and pop" stores.  The largest commercial chain to hit our town while I was growing up was CVS.  How much damage can a couple of sale-priced Band-Aids do when people still take their kids to Dr. Weinstien, the pharmacist, before calling a physician?<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#164;</A></a><br><dd>Anyway, WalMart saw in our humble town two niches- a financial one that it could carve out by mashing local businesses flat, and a physical one in the fallow fields just west of the Lee farm.<br><dd>Unfortunately for the folks who are "all about value," the local merchants (my father among them) banded together with townspeople to oppose the sale of the site to WalMart.  The flaming wreckage of plastic lawnchairs and "Cheryl Teigs" swimwear formed to resemble a WalMart (it was simple-they're square) probably helped to convince them that our town was not ripe for the squeezing.  And if THAT didn't do it, the signs painted on rooftops at the local trailer park- "PLEASE GOD, NOT ANOTHER TWISTER. REMEMBER GOSHEN 1990"<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A></a> and "WALMART SUX!" certainly reinforced the idea.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>So I remained a WalMart virgin until junior year of college. Arguably, before the consummation of our relationship in the form of the Wall-Saver purchase, WalMart and I had done "everything but" when the greeters first forced me to enter the display areas.  These well-meaning elderly people were only there to round out their Social Security payments, basking in the benevolence of Big Blue.  Unfortunately, after greeting me twice, Greeting Associate Maude began to appear visibly upset by my failure to move into the inner sanctum (if an inner sanctum can be a building the size of an aircraft hangar).  Perhaps the bed head, cargo pants, and ripped "Beck Local Crew" shirt were giving her the idea that I was one of those nitrous-sniffing alterna-tot hacker<A NAME="8.8"><A HREF="#8">&#223;</A></a> types obviously up to no good. Perhaps my associates were at that very moment hardwiring the video games into some unfortunate configuration that would detonate the fertilizer over in the Garden Center, resulting in widespread panic and the intolerable interruption of the constant consumption upon which the WalMart empire is based. Perhaps they were even sniffing model airplane glue (which Maude was undoubtedly incredibly allergic to) on their way to do the dastardly deed. In any event, her beady eyes had pinned me against the "SkilCrane" and she had begun to hyperventilate.  It was time to move on.<br><dd>I caught up to Cesar and Skip (who do, in all honesty, look like people capable of cobbling together Sega Genesis systems, a trash can, some STP motor oil, and a bunch of fertilizer into a bomb) in the "snackfood/impulse buy" aisle.  Cesar entered his hardcore social butterfly mode and flamed, "Oh, look who's decided to join us."<br><dd>In a vague Minnesota accent, Skip chuckled: "We've worn her down."<br><dd>"But that woman at the front of the store was giving me the eye," I replied, drawing thumb to middle and ring finger in the age-old "your children will be idgits" gesture I learned from my great-grandmother Assunta.<A NAME="9.9"><A HREF="#9">&#42;</A></a>  "Can we get this over with?"<br><dd>"Gotta get some cat food, wheresah cat food..." mumbled Cesar.  Skip was fixating on the giant bags of Oreos and had to be dragged away by force. Merchandise was everywhere.  It was all I could do not to cower on the brightly waxed "almond puke" patterned linoleum and whimper.  Initially, my brain responded as though taunted by construction workers:<A NAME="10.10"><A HREF="#10">&#149;</A></a><br><dd>"Hey bay-BEE.  You KNOW you want this obnoxious pink and orange sandbucket."<br><dd>"Yo, chicquita, I got some hot stuff over here with these lemon-scented kitchen sponges."<br><dd>You get the idea.  It was awful.  Eventually, though, my American-made brain succumbed.  WalMart was beginning to work its magic.  I don't know what did it first, exactly.  Perhaps it was knowledge that Oreos were a whole fifteen cents cheaper here.  Perhaps it was the wall of haircare products.  The vast, colour-coded expanse of the Housewares area was too much to bear. Cesar had wandered off in search of cat food, but I was lost in the rapture of the Royal Velvet section.  "Skip," I said weakly, "Tell me that I don't need any towels."<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>"Of COURSE you need towels," he replied. Skip is poor at following orders.  My mouth dried out and my extremities began to shake.  I began to feel slightly flushed.  "We've got to get out of here," I croaked, my hands buried in a pile of celery green bath towels.  "We've just got to."<br><dd>"Hey, guys," Cesar called as I was examining a matching toothbrush holder next to the towels.  <br><dd>"Guys, I couldn't find the cat food, but you have GOT to see the 215 CD holder that's on sale."<br><dd>I moaned.  Skip glanced at me with "I can't take you anywhere" irritation.<br><dd>'C'mon," Cesar prodded.  The fluorescent lights became brighter, as though some stockroom employee had located the hidden "blind the consumers and make them know the way" switch, usually only turned on at Christmas and other consumer high holidays, such as Labor Day.  I swayed unsteadily.  Had the coffee from Jay's been drugged?  Had I eaten my last "cheese omelet with homefries and white" ? Was this the end?<br><dd>The thought of all of those matching towels must have caused some sort of shock to my system, because the next thing I remember clearly is standing at the checkout lane as Cesar and Skip purchased cat food, packing tape, a CD holder, and insect spray.  "Jesus," I thought, blearily clinging to the edge of the check-out conveyor belt, "where have I been?"  The cashier, who peered at us through glasses clearly designed to make her eyes appear as small as possible, was not forthcoming.  She collected Skip and Cesars crumpled bills in hands stained with the blood of modest businessmen like my father.  My neck ached vaguely and I deeply craved some Dr. Pepper.  I lurched to the car behind Skip and Cesar, believing that I would never again set foot inside WalMart.<br><dd>Foolish youth had not prepared me for their insidious sales tactics. I now believe that  my physiological response to the WalMart experience was the result of some form of small implant, perhaps inhaled while I was standing over the towels.<A NAME="11.11"><A HREF="#11">&#176;</A></a>  The business began to invade my home in small, insignificant ways.  First, there was the flyer that happened to nestle between the pages of my housemate's Sunday newspaper.  Then there was the direct mailing that found its slimy way into our humble mailbox.  By the time Kristen noted that we could obtain Wall-Saver at WalMart, my brain had subconsciously developed the desire to purchase from the Evil Empire.<br><dd>The first purchase was, of course, the beginning of a rapid descent into the maelstrom of rank consumer gratification.  It took a while to actually FIND the tape, of course.  But since I was going to buy tape anyway, I figured that the little diversions from the ultimate goal wouldn't be quite *so* bad.  We had to sample the Kitchenwares aisle, for instance, where those knives hang out.  The filing cabinets were also seductive, as were the rows of irons, coffeepots, and food processors, all displayed in that charming, haphazard WalMart manner that signals *big value* to the American consumer.  The major marketing strategies in the local WalMart seem to be "hide the product inside an area with many products like it so they'll buy more" and "keep shelves half-stocked and supremely cluttered to create the appearance of "bargain basement" pricing."  We were not to be easily fooled, however, and just barely escaped with the tape before the glue worked its evil voodoo upon us.<br><dd>Later, of course, there were subsequent trips to the WalMart.  By now, I've become something of a seasoned WalMart pilgrim.  It's the appearance of value in the little things that keeps me going back- the shampoo and toilet paper are a little cheaper, as are the hanging file folders.  The furniture still amuses me with its "sneeze on us and we'll disintegrate" nature.  What ultimately draws me back, though, are those WalMart people, who demand that all of their worldly possessions are affordable, in one place, and readily available in any of eighteen check-out lines. <br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"><A NAME="8"><A NAME="9"><A NAME="10"><A NAME="11"></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A>  Let's not examine too closely the logic that allowed me to purchase knives from Lechters or Lechmere.
