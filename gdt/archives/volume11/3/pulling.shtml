Perhaps the Spirit of Vacuum Tubes Past had come to torment the buyers of transistors:<br><dd>"Whoooo...guitar amps just don't have the same sound as they used 				to... whooooo!"<br><dd>In reality, the chill air was due to the freon escaping from the hallowed hut of low-grade electronic equipment and questionably priced widgets. As I entered the door and their photoptic Cerberus barked its piezo-electric chime, I could think only one thing:<br><dd>"...pleasedontaskifyoucanhelpfindanything pleasedontaskifyoucanhelpfindanything..."<br><dd>"Hi. Can I help you find anything?"<br><dd>I looked into the freshly scrubbed face of the red-shirted youth who had me in his sights before I even got through the door. His facial structure made it difficult to tell if he was in high school or college. Clean-shaven with a conservative haircut, he looked as though he was recovering from the ravages of a stubborn acne problem. Reddish welts were still visible on his forehead and temples. I personally had to live through years of acne; the scars stand out plainly on my temples and forehead today. In spite of all this, I felt no rapport with this spring loaded instrument of thinly veiled condescension.<br><dd>For a moment I hesitated. I thought, "Yes, you can leave me alone," but it came out as, "No, thank you. I'll look on my own."<br><dd>I wandered back into the depths of the store looking for...well, I didn't know its official name. Many times I've wandered into a store looking for a product and finally ended up describing how it worked to a clerk in the hope that they could help me find it. Along with assistance, I almost always get a healthy dose of condescension:<br><dd>"Ooooohhhhhh! You want a Model-7 flambang."<br><dd>I guess so. If knew what it was called, I wouldn't have had to describe it to you, you prat. Why can't you simply say, "I think I might have what you need," and take me to it. Instead, you hurl jargon at me as though only the most savage of Calibans wouldn't know about Model-7 flambangs.<br><dd>In this case, I was searching Radio Shack for y-adapter for a computer hard drive power supply. I'd acquired another drive, but lacked the necessary wires to juice it up. Knowing I couldn't possibly be the only person with this problem, I assumed there was an off-the-shelf solution.<br><dd>It's so much easier to go into a situation when you know what's going on than to enter clueless. Sometimes, though, there's just no way to do advance research on something. You have to blunder into things with full knowledge that you'll make faux pas after faux pas...like not knowing what a Model-7 flambang is, for instance.<br><dd>There are all kinds of subtle differences in stores and organizations that affect how comfortable a shopper will be when it comes to asking for help. Some stores don't expect you to know what's going on, and really do try to help. Others just sit back and watch you screw up. I think this is why Wal-Mart is starting to institute the practice of punching receipts as people exit. If you don't know that's the standard operating procedure and the doorman is busy with someone else, big burly men will holler at you as you try to exit. In areas closer to Wal-Headquarters, they frequently punch you <I>and</I> your receipt. There's nothing like dredging up subliminal guilt by invoking memories of childhood shoplifting.<br><dd>Stores like Radio Shack, however, combine the worst of both worlds. They know that given the nature of their wares, most people entering the store won't know the exact phylum, order, and species of their target item. To address this concern, they instruct their clerks to ask people if they need help. In "helping", however, the clerks inadvertently stress that the shopper is on unfamiliar turf.<br><dd>"Pay for your flambang and get outta here, boy. We don't like your kind in these parts."<br><dd>While I was looking around Radio Shack, I found a small stand that had a long articulated arm equipped with two alligator clips and a magnifying glass toward one end. I'd been looking for something like that to help make a sculpture I had in mind, but didn't know what it was called. Suddenly, here it was: "Helping Hands&#153; with magnifier, an indispensable tool for hobbyists." Of course.<br><dd>As I picked up the Helping Hands&#153; and renewed my search, I overheard a customer who had broken down and asked for help.<br><dd><B>Poor Bastard:</B> Hi. I'm not sure what it's called, but I'm looking for a little jobby that plugs into, like, a headphone jack, and lets you plug in a speaker.<br><dd><B>Condescending Clerk:</B> Oh, you mean a....<br><dd>I walked away.<br><dd>Word of advice: never use the word "jobby" when forced to describe a product to a clerk. You immediately go into the "idiot" category. "Jobby" is acceptable only in hardware stores and only when dealing with someone who looks like they've worked in construction for a respectable part of their life.<br><dd>It shortly became apparent that I wasn't going to find my power adapter without help. As I swallowed loudly, my breathing became labored and my palms went damp. Walking up to the poor pimply-faced guy who'd accosted me at the door, I explained what it was that I wanted. A cloud passed over the intricate landscape of his face.<br><dd>"Hmmm. I don't think we sell anything like that."<br><dd>Oh well. I wasn't sure such a thing existed anyway. On the upside, he didn't shame me by rattling off the arcane name of this vapor-product. He scored points for that.<br><dd>This chivalrous young man and I headed for the register when I caught something in my visual periphery and swerved. Nestled amongst the CB equipment and phony surveillance cameras, I saw a number of computer parts. There, looking embarrassed for being caught, was what I'd been seeking. The package proudly tagged it as a "254mm Disk Drive Y-Adapter Power Cable."<br><dd>The pock-faced troll sidled up beside me as I grabbed my prize. Maybe he knew I would have slain him with my "Helping Hands"&#153; if he'd said anything, because he remained blissfully silent. He didn't even process my name and zip code during the checkout, a vital part of the Radio Shack buying ritual. The balance of power, at least this time, had shifted in the customer's favor.<br><dd>There was no time to regale the other shoppers with my tale of victory and determine how best to celebrate. I paid for my toys and escaped into the reassuring warmth of my car. God, how I hated going into situations blind. No, it wasn't that. I hated going into a situation that had specific rules that others simply expected you to know.<br><dd>Arriving home, I packed some clothing and a few boxes. I was on my way to Baltimore, Maryland, a place I'd never been to, and one in which I had no place to stay. In short, I was going in like a cave fish...pasty white and with no foreknowledge. In many respects, it was not unlike a trip to Radio Shack.<br><dd>Needless to say, I was thrilled.<br><IMG  width=250  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images3/pulling.gif"><br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/pulling.html"> Other Pulling a Blank Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
