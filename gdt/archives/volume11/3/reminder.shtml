Personally, I don't give a damn what he did or said. As far as I'm concerned, the question should never have been asked in the first place. What really annoys me is the way history repeats itself and why in hell nobody seems to notice. Maybe it is because it gets in the way of a sensational story, but the only people who seem interested in this "scandal" are the press and the politicians who mistakenly think the media accurately reflects the views of voters.<br> <dd>I'm sick of continually hearing about the "liberal press". The press was liberal once, but those days are long gone. It seems more likely these days that the press is being led along on a rather nice leash, playing dog to the Republican party's master. The press dotes on every word they're dropped; licking it up, smacking their lips, and waiting for more. Not to say that the press is a misguided and na&#239;ve child; on the contrary, they know exactly what they're doing and they're enjoying every minute of it. Reporting news is no longer about, well...reporting news. It's about who's reporting it, it's about the reporter. Members of the press have been riding one big ego trip after another until they don't know their own opinions anymore. What they do know is where the power lies, and who's willing to share it if they say the right thing.<BR><DD>Before anyone says anything about my being a bleeding-heart liberal, stop. I vote democratically, that's true, but not for the reasons you'd suspect. The political system is so derailed at this point that everything is about individuals, and not the public that they are supposed to represent. I maintain that this statement holds true for both the Republican and Democratic parties; this is not one-sided. The act of voting has come down to a choice of who to vote against instead of who to vote for, a decision of which candidate is the lesser of two evils. For that reason alone I vote Democratically, for while I know that neither group will work on my behalf as the voting public, I also know that the Republicans can get things done--things I don't necessarily want getting done. The Republicans can work together as a cohesive group, whereas the Democrats are as capable of harmonious work as my elementary school band was. Thus the lesser of two evils; I intentionally support mediocrity specifically because there are no feasible vehicles for change. No mentions of Ross Perot, please, I said feasible.<br><dd>As a fine example of the Democratic Party's inept attempts at commanding attention and presence, we have the history of the situation which has been so long neglected. Is the righteous American public willing to support a philandering president? We all know the answer to this one, say it with me now.<br><dd>Yes. Need examples? Take Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Ruthorford B. Hayes, just to name a few. History is filled with object lessons in power as an aphrodisiac. Often, men are attracted to high positions of office precisely for that reason.<br><dd>"Wait a minute, wait a minute," somebody says, "this is not an issue of sexual misconduct, but an issue of trust. The president lied under oath. That's perjury."<br><dd>Huh. Well, yes, it is, but will the American public elect a president who has no difficulty in lying to them? Why not? They've done it before. Why, there's already a precedent for it.<br><dd>Take your thoughts back to a story about a great American hero, Lieutenant Colonel Emeritus Oliver North. North was touted as a hero when the whole Iran-Contra story broke. For the moment, we will disregard the fact that these were highly illegal actions and attend to the meat of the matter: then-Vice President Bush stated under oath that he had never attended any of the meetings associated with the Iran-Contra scandal. Yet after Caspar Weinberger stated under oath that he had not taken notes of these meetings, it happened that his non-existent notes were found and clearly demonstrated that such meetings had been attended by the Vice President. Shortly thereafter, we the people elected him to the presidency. Are the circumstances so different? In one case, we elect a president who lies about an affair he is having with an intern while in office. In the other, we elect a man to office knowing that he is more than willing to purjure himself before Congress and the American public in order to disavow his involvement in highly illegal activities. Obviously, the American public has already proven its indifference to having such men in office.<br> <dd>Our history tells us that this sort of thing has happened before and that the men involved were often esteemed statesmen and/or great presidents, so why is it so different now? It isn't; the only difference is the way the press is covering it: "...the nation is outraged...." The nation isn't outraged. The Republicans are jubilant, the Democrats are flustered (their natural state), the general public is bored off their couch-shaped keisters, and the only one who may have a right to be outraged is the first lady. Leave the story at that and let's get on with the business of national politics as usual.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
