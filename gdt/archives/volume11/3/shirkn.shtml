We'll show you how to stop the bleeding on HealthBeat!") recently.  A woman in her early thirties was being interrogated by a floating microphone.  When asked why she never misses an episode of "The Jerry Springer Show," she promptly replied that it made her thankful for what she doesn't have.<br><dd>Presumably, she was talking about gratitude for what life has given her: good health, shiny hair, a professional-looking wardrobe.  This is a lovely sentiment, and the woman should be commended for appreciating life in such a way.<br><dd>As you and I know, however, this woman must be severely mentally handicapped.<br><dd>Anyone who uses "The Jerry Springer Show" as an opportunity for introspection and quiet reflection on their personal Horn of Plenty should be shot in the face.  Apparently, it is all too easy to mistake the cheap thrill of tawdry voyeurism for a warm feeling of self-worth.<br><dd>"Boy, am I grateful that <I>I'm</I> not the World's Fattest Stripper!"<br><dd>People watch Jerry Springer because they can relate to Jerry Springer, and because they like to pretend that they're better than other people.<br><dd>First of all, Jerry's television persona is a lot like you and I.  He's done some things he regrets (such as paying hookers with personal checks while Mayor of Cincinnati), but for the most part, he's a humble guy.  He was born in London of parents fleeing the Holocaust and grew up in the Midwest.  Think about it.  An immigrant from America's Heartland.  Who could be more accessible to the most coveted audience in television, the Average Joe?  Besides retarded Nazis, I mean.<br><dd>Springer's true brilliance is this, though: when it comes to his guests, he is just as indignant and self-righteous as you are.  The man is a certified champion when it comes to seizing the moral high ground.  His show becomes a pecking party.  Jerry draws the lines between the Good Guests and the Bad Guests, and the studio audience delivers the beatings.<br><dd>This isolation of society's evil element does give average idiots a morale boost; I will credit our misguided interviewee for that meager insight.  Her fatal error, though, is affecting a positive stance on that warm feeling.  In fact, the charge she gets from watching Springer in action is not directed inward, but rather at the rest of America.  This woman has a marginally fucked-up life (as we all do).  Her only relief is to transform her fear and self-pity into hatred for and judgement of those she believes to be <I>really</I> fucked-up.<br><dd>Amazing that I understand all this about a woman I've never met, just by seeing her on television for 5 seconds, isn't it?<br><dd>A little bit ironic, too.<br><dd>I'm guilty of the same crimes.  The difference is that I'm more articulate about it.<br><dd>And did you believe me?  Were you convinced?  Were you laughing at that woman, and thanking God above that you're not her?  Somehow, I think so. We're all ridiculous individuals, and we all like to see each other drown. Amen.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <center><hr width = 450><br></center><font size=+1><dd><B>"Do what you want / Do all you can / Break all the fuckin' rules / And go to Hell with Superman / And die like a champion, ya-hey!"<br> <center>-Bad Religion, "Do What You Want"</B><br></center></font size><br><hr width = 450><br></center></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>It's almost too easy for adults to ignore young smartasses like us.  After all, what the hell do we know?  We haven't been anywhere or done anything yet.  Most of us aren't married, don't own homes, and have never been sent to other countries to kill people.  We haven't experienced the acceptable amounts of pain and responsibility necessary for adulthood.  We can still mock the world, because the world hasn't chewed us up to show us who's boss.<br><dd>Our youthful naivete is our greatest asset, though, and precisely for that reason.  We still have the ability to learn, to think, to question.  The authority figures in our lives haven't beaten it out of us.  We think we're immortal.  We think we know everything.  We see the absurdity of our surroundings, from redundant bureaucracies to transparent authority to that guy over there with a football helmet and no pants on.  We laugh at it, half because we want to change it for ourselves and half because we're afraid of what it will do to us.<br><dd>We see our parents and our teachers, miserable in their dead-end careers with defeated looks in their eyes.  We know that most of the people we are taught to respect have never been worthy of us.  When we break the rules, we do so because the rules are stupid.  When they abuse the power that they wield over us, we know they are trying to make our lives as joyless as theirs turned out to be.<br><dd>They tell us that these are (everyone together, now) "The Best Years Of Your Life."  In essence, this is "Enjoy it while you can, brats, because sooner or later life will shit on you, and you'll end up just like me." Don't judge them too harshly, though; they are merely longing for the freedom they once had.  They envy us our idealism.  They had our opportunity, and missed it.  They fell in line - the slow march to death, punctuated with marriage, career, and family.<br><dd>But what do they want from us?  What do they want for us?  As mentors, they want us to succeed; it reflects well on them.  As people, though, they'd rather us fall into the same line humans have marched from the beginning of civilized society.  How discouraging, to see those younger than you, whom you have always dismissed as ignorant and trivial, succeed where you failed! How embarrassing!  Outwardly, they are proud of your accomplishments.  In their minds, they wonder where they went wrong.<br><dd>We are born with powers beyond our comprehension.  Throughout our lives, those powers are disciplined out of us.  We forget what we are capable of. We are made to choose a life without learning, without creation.  We can, however, break out of that course.  We can use our immeasurable abilities to forge our own meandering path.  In the end, we will have died like champions.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><center><hr width = 450><br><font size=+2><B>Party at the P.D.!</B></center></font size><br><hr width = 450><br></center></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>When I was arrested, I was taken to a "booking room" to be "booked."
