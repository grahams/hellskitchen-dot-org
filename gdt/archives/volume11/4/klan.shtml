The trial assessed punitive damages against the Klan's national organization on the order of $15 million. Several individual members of the Klan were singled out with $100,000 punitive claims. A further $15 million in damages was claimed against Horace King ("H-Dogg" in the SC hood), the Grand Dragon of the Klan's South Carolina chapter.<br><B>H-Dogg's net value:</B> A small house, an old shed, a chicken coop, 7 acres of land, and many towering burnt crosses.<br><B> Estimated value:</B> NO MAN CAN TELL.<br><dd>In H-Dogg's defense, lawyers tried to portray him as a decrepit old man who just talked a lot (a cracker who could bust phat rhymes but didn't have any rhythm. Bounce). H-Dogg is famous for saying such uplifting things to his constituents as "This is a white man's country, and if the niggers don't like it, put them on a rowboat and send them back to Africa to swing from coconut trees and eat one another." Damn. Definitely a man who knows his horticulture and is quite in tune with all of the latest in anthropophagous activities. He sounds like a real spry grandfatherly type, I'm sure the little kids just love him. Then again the little kids seemed to have just adored Hitler too, when he wasn't busy making sure that the ashes of their families were spread to the four winds.<br> <dd>What H-Dogg really needs is to be admitted to a nursing home for the incurably senile with plenty of condescending orderlies. Orderlies with strict instructions to make certain that the old geezer will be painfully aware of his bedsores long enough to develop new ones. Whole droves of individuals plaintively nodding their heads, saying, "That's right H-Dogg, coconuts all over Africa, yes, yes H, uphill both ways. Of course it was. You know it's time for your electro-shock therapy now."<br><dd>H would fit well in Big Nurse's ward, where the young black orderlies could lube him up and put their throbbing black members up his tight South Carolina sphincter. Mr. King may enjoy the tearing sensation he feels.<br><table cellpadding = 15 width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000></A><font color = white><font size=+2><center>Be a Klan Pal&reg;!<p></font size></center> <dd>Write to H-Dogg or one of his boys at http://www.kkk.com/ kkkontactsnf.htm  ("Dear H-Dogg, I want to be a hate monger.")<p><dd>Of course, you may have to enclose a makeshift coloring book, as many Klan members can't read very well.<br></font color></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/af.html">Adam Fletcher</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
