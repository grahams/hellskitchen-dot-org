But as is often the case, the Forces of Evil&#153; managed to use these wonderful little buggers to make the world a more neurotic place. Let me explain:<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images4/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Thanks to millions of years of evolution, primates have developed the fight-or-flight reaction to stress. In the wild, prior to Prometheus' intervention, man<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> really had nothing going for him. No claws, no prehensile tails, no wings, a poor selection of hair extensions. In fact, we weren't even all that good to eat, but that didn't stop the other animals from killing us for sport.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a> This meant that from a primate's point of view, everything that moved was a) food b) a mate or c) a predator. Enter adrenaline. Thanks to this wonderful little hormone, our bodies become supercharged when threatened. Our pupils enlarge to allow us to see more color, our reflexes become faster, we become more resistant to pain, and our strength is increased. Back then, it allowed us to escape a cat souped up on noradrenilin (adrenaline makes monkeys jumpy; noradrenilin makes cats stalky). Nowadays, it makes us shoot other monkeys sitting in rush hour traffic.<br><dd>The take-home is that when there are things moving in our peripheral vision, we're hardwired to half-think that it's something that's going to try to eat us. So when you're sitting in front of your computer screen reading an article on the web and there's an animated gif in the corner doing some sort of wacky dance, your anxiety rises. Best of all, you're not even sure why. All you're certain of is that you want to bust a move.<br><dd>For the people who make the animated gifs, it doesn't matter why you feel jumpy. What matters is that it increases your anxiety. Fnords (or as any dyslexic can point out FNORDS=F WORDS) by any other name.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#167;</A></a> Still, an anxious monkey is not a very happy monkey, and they're a bit more open to suggestions on how to decrease their stress.<br> <dd>Buy, buy, buy!<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#181;</A></a> It's no surprise that most animated gifs placed in strategic locations (read: at the edge of your peripheral vision) are adverts<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#223;</A></a> for one product or another. The implication being that if we buy things, our well-being will increase, ending this annoying anxiety.<A NAME="8.8"><A HREF="#8">&#128;</A></a> And that's really what most advertising is about. Buy our product and you will be a better person in some way, shape, or form (ergo the Wonder Bra&#153; and strap-on dildos).<br> <dd>The masters of this form of marketing are the fine bastards at De Beers (now owned by Disney!<A NAME="9.9"><A HREF="#9">&#149;</A></a>), the people who brainwashed the world into believing diamonds are something to cherish (and Pocahontas was of age) and not something that is only useful when used to deface mirrors and windows. Prior to their taking control of the worlds supply of diamonds, there were no such things as diamond engagement rings (or hobbled South Africans). But that didn't stop them. Through masterful manipulation of the public's insecurities (Kids: Frats!), sense of romance and plain old fashioned bullshit (none of this new fangled crap), De Beers convinced the western world that "Diamonds are Forever," just as one's love should be. What better way to symbolize an eternal love than with sparkly carbon?<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images4/1.2.gif"><br><dd>This wasn't a fluke occurrence on the part of De Beers, either. Prior to the 1960s, less than 10% of the women in Japan wore diamonds. After a custom-made advertising campaign evoking the Japanese need to maintain ties to their past and culture, while capitalizing on their insecurities about interacting with those from the west, De Beers won. Under the premise that diamonds are a perfect symbol of one's love that combines the simplicity of Shinto with the chic of the West, over 60% of Japanese women wear diamonds today.<A NAME="10.10"><A HREF="#10">&#176;</A></a> All of which were sold by De Beers.<br><dd>It's as though we walk about with Slinkies attached to the sides of our heads. Every movement we make makes the thing wiggle a bit in our peripheral vision, firing the sense that something is going to eat us, making us want to buy things to make it all right. We're a consumer culture powered by the threat of predatory Slinkies!<br> <dd>Not all adverts are Slinkies, however. Slinky ads are only those that try to get us to buy the product though sublimation. Take the woman with beautiful breasts draped over a car. What are they selling there? At some level those of us interested in fantastic breasts might wish that `twas the woman we could get for $19,000 with 1.9% financing, $100 down and you can drive her home today. Instead, we connect our desire to breed with the car and end up with that. We can observe the same phenomena in most jean commercials. People dancing about...what the hell are they selling? Swing? Malnourished Gap children?<A NAME="11.11"><A HREF="#11">&#248;</A></a> But no, it's jeans.<br> <dd>Much like the bouncing breast of the car and the bouncing felt lined women of the swing era, the Slinky ad is easy to recognize.  Just ask yourself this question: does it make you want anything other than the product? If so, it's a Slinky, and like most Slinkies, all the ad is going to do is get tangled up in itself and be thrown away.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"><A NAME="8"><A NAME="9"><A NAME="10"><A NAME="11"></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Which are the coolest things since sliced bread.

After the kill, the foxes would stand about the dead body, ready to be mounted in a suitably fierce pose, his absent claws ready to appear at any moment. The hunters would mumble chic phrases like "Jolly good," and "a spot of tea, darling?" whilst gloating over their fashionable kill.  This was so traumatic to the aforementioned bipeds that these hunts eventually became genetic memories which, through a misunderstood force of nature,<font color=blue>&#165;</font color> manifests itself today in the British Isles.<BR><font color=blue>&#165;</font color> Similar to gravity, the force of irony one event applies upon another is the absurdity of the opposing event multiplied by the universal ironic constant divided by the square probability of these events occurring simultaneously.
