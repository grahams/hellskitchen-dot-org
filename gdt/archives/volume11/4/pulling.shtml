When it comes down to it, it's just a mass of humans pressed together staring at a few people up on stage and being subjected to music loud enough to alter the regularity of their heartbeats. That's what I tell myself, but really it's just 'cause I don't have fun. Lots of people getting in my way as I try to listen to music that I have on CD at home? Yeah, this is fun. Whee.<br><dd>"There's nothing like a live show," concert hoppers might say. Well, they're absolutely right. Then again, there's nothing like an acetic acid enema.<br> <dd>Still, I allowed myself to get suckered into going to Lollapalooza when it stopped in Rhode Island. Mind you, I went to spend time with friends, not for the music. The plan was that we'd drive down on the night before so we'd be there before the road got too crazy. Never mind that none of us had a vehicle large enough for six or seven people to travel comfortably from central Maine to Rhode island.<br> <dd>One friend, Nate, seemed sure that it would all work out. "I'll take care of it," he said with a smile.<br> <dd>It was around 7pm when we all met at a friend's house. As we sat on the lawn, waiting for our hypothetical ride, a full sized van painted flat grey and speckled with the obvious traces of Bond-o and duct tape pulled up and parked. With a broad grin, Nate put the engine out of its misery and climbed out.<br> <dd>"You bought a van?" an incredulous voice behind me asked.<br> <dd>"Yeah. We'll use it to get there and back, then I'll sell it. Load 'em up!"<br><dd>I was already regretting the decision to go. When someone buys a vehicle as a sort of disposable chariot and they have no more money than I do, I can't help but wonder, "What are they fucking thinking!?" Still, I placed my pillow and backpack in the back and we were soon on our way.<br><dd>As is often the case when dealing with half-assed operations, there were numerous last minute details to work out. I'd been on a carrot kick for a few months at that time, so I bought a pound of them, a bottle of Sprite, and the biggest bag of Cool Ranch Doritos I could find.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Everyone else had to pick up various sundries and make the necessary calls ("Hi, mom? I'm 18 and I'm going to a concert. See ya Sunday..."). We dicked around for a few hours trying to get a few more people to join us. Around midnight, we were finally headed south.<br> <dd>As we drove into the night with our headlights compromising the utter blackness of Maine highway ahead of us, the magic of night-driving began to overtake me. We drove in short shifts, with the driver-on-deck getting the coveted shotgun position as well as control of the music. By 3am, it was my turn to drive.<br> <dd>Anyone who's stayed awake for most of the night knows that there is a time somewhere between 2 and 4 when the body simply rebels at a severe lack of sleep. One tends to go a little numb, cold sets in, and the world takes on a sort of homogeneous feel. This was happening to me, but sleep didn't seem interested in visiting me. My co-pilot, however, had succumbed quickly to the biological need.  Those in back had drifted off to slumber long ago.  Looking at them in the rearview mirror, they all seemed like small children, tuckered out after having played hard all day. Some even had the faintest hint of a smile on their faces, eyelids flickering as they watched secrets they would forget about by morning.<br> <dd>The end of my shift came, but I pressed on. I wasn't tired, and was actually enjoying the drive. The hum of the tires on the road and the emptiness of the highway were appealing. It was as though the night were made for escape; not only in the form of sleep, but escape for those like me trying to get away from people for a just a little while.<br> <dd>The world is different in the early morning. Maybe people project fields about them when they're awake. It's like a little radio saying, "Here I am," that builds up until it is an overwhelming jumble of interference, drowning everything else out. Thousands of voices say, "Here I am," at different times, making white noise. But at 4am, the world is calm. I didn't feel rushed or bothered or anxious. It felt like being deep in the woods of Maine in winter, where the sounds of cars, planes, and the various sounds of man are too far away to hear. All that's left is the creaking of naked trees in the wind, and the echo of your movements as the snap of a twig burrowing under the snow runs away from you across the crusted forest floor.<br> <dd>Then, the earth started to fall. I was going more or less in a north-south direction then, so my left side window slowly filled with the light of the sun. The world expanded from just what my headlights touched to a washed out landscape of grey. The colours returned with the light, moving through the pastels until they were almost garish compared to how I'd seen then earlier. Finally, the corona of the sun appeared over the horizon. More and more was exposed until I couldn't look directly at it. At the same time, things were becoming active again. The cars increased in number on the road, and the feeling of being surrounded by white noise slowly settled back in.<br> <dd>We arrived at our destination, and by 6:30 vehicles were already beginning to fill the lots set aside for concert goers. After finding an open spot, I shut the vehicle off, hoping no one would wake. Everyone was still lost in whatever worlds they had created in their dreams. I reclined my seat and took a much needed nap.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> The first party I went to in high school was thrown by a girl who I had a crush on for years. I say party, but it was really just eight of us who got together to watch the old black-and-white version of "Great Expectations" and chill out listening to Pink Floyd in the dark while we made up stories.  Anyway, I was feeling very out of place, being bombarded with unknown music, slang, and eloquence in a mix that made me giddy and joyful. One of the new things I was exposed to were Cool Ranch Doritos. I ate these all night, and had a grand time of it. In short, I was in a Skinner Box where I was trained to associate Doritos with having a good time. I think it helps that I got a scalp rub from the object of my affection while eating them, too. <BR> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/pulling.html"> Other Pulling a Blank Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
