Everyone is their own model of morality, character, and ethics.<br><dd>We have these ideals, instilled in us through our socialization - through television, religion, through our interaction with others.  We have a very hard time breaking the cast (and the caste) forged for us at birth, and seeing things in a different way.<br><dd>One thing that I can say for people who wish to dilute my thoughts, and the way I express them - these people understand, on some level, that it's easier to listen to the good news than the bad news.  It's easier to all 'get together and feel all right' a la Bob Marley than it is to tell Ian MacKaye why 'everybody wants their own damn station.'<br><dd>What upsets me, though, is that so many messages are lost in the translation.  The easily offended demand a sanitary world.  They strive to create a world that includes only what they want to see and hear.  They cover their eyes and ears like the famous monkeys, but what they speak is evil.  That any mention of sex, of drugs, of crime, of certain viruses should be capital crime is, to me, pure evil.<br><dd>But these meek minds have been given a weapon - the Almighty Lawsuit. A simple trick: if you want some artist's expression bastardized, tell a lawyer that this artist's work has traumatized you and demand recourse. The artist, who doesn't have as much money as you do (artists don't demand payment in the name of God), will then be forced to alter his work.<br><dd>"Your Honor, I was mentally unprepared for this heathen's assault on my tradition of narrow-mindedness, and was therefore sent into a state of immediate shock when his painting suggested that buying yachts and holding fund-raisers for my political campaign do not constitute moral majority. <br><dd>"As a result, I was forced to write angry letters to the editor with paranoid rantings about threats to my already spoiled children."<br> <dd>"Right on, Bob.  I hereby sentence the defendant to paint some happy trees and a cheerful regatta scene.  Let's have a bourbon."<br> <dd>Once again, our only hope in battling this attack on expression is our own generation.  Unfortunately, imbecile parents raise imbecile children, and our efforts to break and reset their stubborn minds are only met with a stronger false idealism.  Multiply the ill-conceived attitudes of an adult by the pointless impudence of a young adult and you get a veritable monument to stagnant thinking.<br><dd>We can only rely on the cues of our parents and teachers for moral guidance for so long before a stiffness of the mind sets in.  Most of us strive for financial, social and cultural independence, but entirely ignore our own powers of moral judgement.  That is, until our elders' ideals are cemented so firmly in our consciousness that we cannot undo that damage. Instead, we choose to raise our children in the same prison that we once inhabited.<br><dd>Perhaps there is no hope for our peers.  We certainly cannot force our opinions on them - we would be committing the same crimes that were committed against us.  We can, however, encourage those we see in spiritual and intellectual ruts to rethink their position.<br><dd>We would be sinning against our own good judgement to weaken our thoughts, or withhold our thoughts from expression, simply to pacify others.  Altering what we think because of someone else's indignation must be avoided, and at all costs.  If people don't like what we do or say, then that is their problem.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><B><font size = +1><center>Mary Ellen, You're My Hero</center></B></font size><p> </td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd> The waitress startled me.<br><dd> "Are you at that table?" she asked.<br><dd> "No, I'm by..." I answered.<br> <dd>"By yourself?  Okay, that's fine..."<br> <dd>"I was just going to take a counter seat."  An unnecessary explanation.<br> <dd> "Okay.  Do you want a coffee?"<br><dd> "Yes, please."<br><dd> "Okay, the special is two pancakes, two eggs, two bacon or sausage for two fifteen."  She was talking in that practiced rhythm that waitresses adopt only after several years of dealing with irate customers.  It was an even, neutral voice - warm, but without any inflection that could possibly offend me.  Every time I hear that voice, I get the feeling I could slit my wrists at the table and the waitress would be unfazed.<br><dd> "Yeah, I'll have the special scrambled with a side of home fries.  Oh, and with bacon, please.  And could I get a glass of ice water?"<br> <dd>"Sure thing..."  She was scribbling.<br><dd>I picked up the copy of "The Phishing Manual" that long-haired Eric had lent me.  My food arrived in record time.  I put the book down, and began gorging myself.  The waitress was making snappy chat with regular customers, which I half-heard as I devoured my meal.  A thoroughly dowdy woman entered, and the waitress recognized her immediately.<br><dd> "Good morning, Mary Ellen!"<br><dd> "Hello, dear."  The woman was a little heavy, with plain features, a bowl haircut, and an old overcoat.  She walked to the counter, put her pocket book by the seat next to mine, and began to ease herself onto the stool.<br> <dd>"Would you like a coffee?"<br> <dd>"Yes."<br><dd>The woman looked at me.<br> <dd>"This is my favorite seat.  That's why I squeezed into it."<br>  <dd> "Right on."  I didn't know how to respond. I finished my meal and went to the register to pay my check.  When I returned to the counter to put down a tip, the woman pointed at "The Phishing Manual."<br><dd>"What's this word?" she asked.<br> <dd>"'Phishing,'" I answered, "spelled with a 'Ph.'  It's a book about a band called Phish..."<br>  <dd> "Oh, spelled with a 'Ph.'  I get it."  She finished the sentence for me.<br>  <dd> It is very comforting to me that there are millions of people in the world who have never heard of Phish.  I know that they are not missing anything terribly important.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><B><font size = +1><center>We Must Protect Our (22 Year-Old) Children!</center></B></font size><p> </td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>"There's a cheerleader here, wants to help with my paper / Let her do all the work, then maybe later I'll rape her."<br> <dd>-Frank Zappa, "Bobby Brown"<p>   <dd>"Andrea would never let me listen to that song, dude."<br><dd> "Oh yeah?

Jack's point there was that..."<br><dd>"Yeah, but he was laughing at it.  She thought that was out of line."<br><dd>"He was laughing at it because pro-life organizations are trying to abolish something they deem atrocious and offensive.  The way they get it accomplished is by doing things that are atrocious and offensive.  You don't think that's a little bit ironic?"<br><dd>"She had just met Jack.  She didn't understand what he was getting at."<br><dd> So Jack and Frank Zappa are eliminated from Ted's life because his girlfriend ignores the argument and takes the image at face value.<br><dd>Who is at fault here?
