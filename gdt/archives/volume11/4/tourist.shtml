I know that you've all missed me, and I have a plethora (of pi&#241;atas?) of stories to share with you.  For those of you who aren't in the loop, I'll recap the last few months.  I left the balmy sands of Rochester to pursue the movie career.  The magic number, boys and girls is 1.6 Million Clams, ("OUTBID BY MINE OWN WENCH!!!!").  That is the green light number for the work in progress tentatively entitled "Blue Skies".  This ain't no student film.  The happy folks in Film/Video didn't want to play ball, so I decided that it would be in my best interest to disassociate with them for a while, a leave of absence if you will.  I shall one day make my glorious return to campus, with a tidy little indie piece under my belt.  I'm layin' this down from my home state of Maryland, so there's no need to worry about missing the scintillating wit and probing social insight of the TMR.  I'll be going strong the whole year, and will keep everyone posted as to the progress of the film.  For those of you contorting your brows in disdain of the pretentious film school dropout clich&#233; that I have set before you,<br> <dd><I>Get Bent.</I><br><dd>You little bastards go right on talking about how a guy you know PA'd on the set of the latest Kevin Smith film. Meanwhile, the pirates amongst us, the mighty conquistadors (myself included), will be raping life for all it's worth and smiling at the benefits of uncertainty.  Enough already, here's the review.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><font size=+2><center><B>This Week - "Armageddon"</B></font size></center><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>Say it with me now:<br><dd>Jerry Bruckheimer!  For those of you who don't know who he is, Jerry Bruckheimer (pronounced: JURy brUKhimRRRRRR really fast) is the producer behind such culturally enriching films like "Top Gun", "The Rock", "Days of Thunder", and most recently, "Armageddon".  His former partner, Don Simpson, did too much blow and kicked it while producing "The Rock" in 1996.  But the legend continues, with JURy brUKhimRRRRR blowing away box office naysayers with large swings of the commercial sword.  But you gotta see this guy to really appreciate the experience.  Forget the plot holes, forget the SAME GODDAMN MUSIC IN EVERY FUCKING FILM, forget the super-slow-mo action sequences where big burly men run against wind machines to accentuate the hair extensions and fake sweat.  No, in order to experience a JURy brUKhimRRRRR film to the fullest, first find a picture of that kooky kat.  Just look in any Entertainment Weekly or Premiere magazine.  Find the obligatory hot star in a pensive moment black turtleneck style photo (OHSIAPMBTSP) of se&ntilde;or brUKhimRRRRR and check out the stubble.  Really examine the stubble.  Get out the fresnel bookmark if you have to.  See how it's perfectly unkempt???  How does he do that?<br><dd>Doesn't matter.  Take a look at the stubble, and imagine the cool announcer from every goddamn action trailer you've ever seen and hear these words in your head:<br><dd>From the Producer of Armageddon  and The Rock, And the director of Armageddon and The Rock. A simple bodily function, a genetic holdover from homo habilis, Remington, a cold steel adversary, No match for the oily power...Paramount Pictures proudly presents A JURy brUKhimRRRR production of a JURy brUKhimRRRR film:<p><B>JURy brUKhimRRRRR's Stubble</B><p><dd>Now picture the stubble shown from a hundred different angles in like 2 picoseconds.  Then add the pseudo-symphonic Hans Zimmer music.   Add sound clips like "It's growing!!",  "I've got to get my team out!", "We've tried electrolysis, it didn't work.  You're the only person who can do it.",  or "Shave this..."  Throw a few beauty shots of a confused, out of breath Nicholas Cage, and you've got it.  The essence of JURy brUKhimRRRRR - his sleazy producer stubble.  Now you're ready for "Armageddon."<br><dd>I must admit that the film itself was rather interesting for the first half hour or so.  It just started to get bad when they went into space. With a high budget, I personally feel that there is NO EXCUSE for lack of accuracy.  Given, the viewer will always succumb to a sort of lax compliance/suspension of disbelief when watching a work of fiction. However, some things in "Armageddon" were just inexcusable.  Too numerous to list here, I'll just comment on the glaring errors.<br>  <dd>First off, two shuttles launching at the same time???  Did the fucker who wrote the film ever see "The Right Stuff" or even "Apollo 13"???  Hell, why not the actual NASA TV that comes on public access all the time?  With a single spacecraft in the air, NASA is this:<br><dd>Seven guys in space, two thousand guys sitting at desks.  And that's just for one launch.  Yeah, yeah, the whole dire circumstances, but really.  A simple change like placing the second launch in France or Japan or the USSR would have sufficed.  I would have had no problems.<br><dd>Second, since when did MIR become a fucking Exxon station?  Hey, I've got a great idea for a scene.  Let's give Yakov Smirnoff some 'ludes and throw him up in MIR, the interstellar gas station, and "add gravity" by spinning the whole damn thing.  What, did the fact-checker snort one rail too many with Don Simpson???  You don't add gravity to a space station that's configured like MIR. It is possible if the station is laid out in a concentric ring design (see 2001), but it ain't happenin' up in MIR.<br><dd>Third, since when has a Vulcan cannon been standard drilling equipment? That's just something that you don't seem to find on most deep core rigs.<br>  <dd>There are many more, and I shan't be picayune about them.  I will, however, give my two cents as to how the film could have been made so much better.<br><OL><LI> Use the actual Ving Rhames in the film, instead of some other dude as the obligatory exceedingly- large- yet- loyal- and- totally- cuddly- black- guy.  <LI> Start the film with Bruce Willis blowing Ben Affleck's brains all over the room as he's a-poundin' a fully nude and sweaty Liv Tyler.  Get Ben out of there real quick.<LI>  Any time there's a close shot of a console or display, preface every function or switch with "BAT", as in:  "I dunno, I'll have to check the Bat-depth gauge..."<LI>Have Bruce Willis give Robert Duvall's shuttle the finger as they pass each other on their way to their respective hurtling-towards-earth space objects.<li>  After they draw straws (where in the hell did the straws come from??), have them pass around a big fat blunt.  When Bruce Willis decides to be the altruistic hero type (remember, we've dispensed with Ben Affleck), have the whole crew blow that sweet smoke into Bruce's helmet before he rides the lotto-machine-elevator thing down to his certain doom.</OL><dd>And finally, what I expected to see, but didn't and was absolutely heartbroken over:   after the asteroid has been destroyed and the heroes are on their way home, have the camera pan across the flying debris to a swiftly moving chunk heading for the Earth's atmosphere.  There, upon the rocky mass, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry stand with a microphone, wailing "Don't Wanna Miss A Thing" and surfing on the asteroid like there's no tomorrow, while dragging JERy brUKhimRRRR's bludgeoned corpse like a little rag doll behind them!  I would have stood up and cheered, maybe even unbolted my seat and thrown it at the screen in triumph.  But no. I walked sadly to the car, and drove to a place that would compliment the film's disappointment - The Olive Garden, a place just as fake, just as commercial, just as clich&#233;d, except with free breadsticks and salad.  All for now, children.<br>  <dd>Sleepytime.
