Speak mistruths? You must have the wrong girl or, at the very least, the wrong column. You see, since the culmination of this column back in 1995 the truth and I have had a very "special" relationship, take that however you want. I don't bother my pretty little head over it and in return for this social nicety, it doesn't bother to correct me.<br><dd>Since you've been reading GDT, is this the first time you've found something I've written in this column to be questionable? Come now, this isn't right. In my illustrious past I have claimed that the main tenent of Quakerism lies in the vast consumption of oatmeal, all the love in the world has gone to a small island in the South Pacific, the best way to ensure midgets can give live birth is by feeding them massive quantities of crack, and that turtles have retractable necks like tape measures. Not to mention the time I talked about my penis and chest hair.<br> <dd>Now I want you to take a Zen moment to reflect on whether the assumption of truth has any baring on the way I answer questions.<br><dd>Ready? Good. The last time I checked the title of this little segment was, "Ask the Bare-foot Girl", not "Let the Bare-foot Girl Tell you the Truth" or even "Let the Bare-foot Girl Lull You Into a False Sense of Security." In fact, none of the ads for the Bare-foot Girl have ever indicated that I need include any amount of truth to any of the statements I make what-so-ever.<br><dd>So, now that we are all up to speed I will tell you what I do in this column. I don't necessarily answer truthfully. As Jane Martin wrote, "The truth like incites people to fuck with you." I don't necessarily answer quaintly, properly, or even lucidly. What I do is answer as colorfully as I can.<br><dd>All that aside, it is time to devote a little time to this question of yours. Ayn Rand is probably rolling in her grave after that. Okay, maybe not. She's probably just pondering the many virtues of Ronald Reagan. Of course, there is a better way to motivate advances and utility while fostering cooperation instead of intellectual property.  It's really quite simple, as history has shown any number of variations on the theme to crop up just about anywhere in the world. You may have heard of it: it's called fear.<br><dd>The Romans were masters of it, known throughout their world as the great assimilators, pushing this beautiful model of cooperation.<br><dd>"I was wondering if you might be willing to tell me how you work out this load and stress thing for the foundation?... Oh, really? I understand. In that case, I have a few seats at the Coliseum if you'd like them. Or maybe I should give them to your family? I hear the lions are really voracious this time of year. ...You're kidding. I'm so glad to hear that, Caesar will be so pleased!"<br><dd>Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito, Reagan (there's that name again), heck, all the really big world leaders are doing it. Remember McCarthy? Those were the days. What's good for world politics has got to be good for the economy. I mean, it's not as if our leaders would ever do anything that would be construed as unbecoming leadership for our nation?<br><dd>Remember, four legs good, two legs baaahdd!<p>Never Humbly,<br> <dd>the Bare-foot Girl<br><center><IMG   SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images5/bfg.gif"></center><br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
