Alas, I too am a member of that ever-present press monster.  I can only compensate for that by offering you a bit of sage business advice, instead of reporting the issue any farther.<br>  <dd>In the light of the recently released Kenneth Starr Report, I feel that you should change your philosophy towards the whole incident.  Instead of shying away from the public eye and "getting your life back", you should do what all good Americans do in times of public turmoil - capitalize! How, you may ask?  By selling your story to the highest bidder?  Heavens no.  That would bring in only a few thousand or so, and make you even more despicable in the public eye.  I suggest the following course of action.<br><dd>According to your deposition in the Starr Report, President Clinton inserted a cigar into your vagina.  Since the barrage of media coverage into the incident, not one person in the independent council or the press community has asked what happened to the cigar. Did he place it back in the container?  Did he smoke it after he ejaculated?  Did he present it to an ambassador or top official in the Soviet Union?  Did you take it for a keepsake?  Why am I asking this?  Dollar signs, sweetheart.  Plain and simple.Cuban cigars can sell for hundreds, depending on the brand and type, simply because the elite who smoke them want their cigars rolled on the inner thighs of Cuban virgin women.  Can you see what I'm getting at here? What kind of guy would want a cigar rolled on the inner thighs of Cuban virgin women if they can have a cigar coated in the sweet nectar of Monica Lewinsky's "nether-region"?  No doubt, the social elite would pay top dollar for a MONICA BLUNT, or a LEWINSKY ESPECIAL.  All you'd have to do is put up the cash for a cheap box of cigars (doesn't matter the brand), stick them in for a bit, put em' back in the box, and call it a work day. Sell them for $200 a pop, tie in with a nationwide Playboy ad campaign, and you're set.  You could make a cool million in a matter of weeks and skip out of the US and live a fruitful life in a third world, non-English speaking  country.<br><dd>This is just a suggestion, and in no way a personal attack on your character.  I wish you good luck in the future, and if possible, a 10% cut of the profits.  Thank you and have a nice day.<p>Sincerely,<br> <dd>Tourist<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
