They do a great job of convincing me that no one does any thinking anymore.<br><dd>Our idealism has been reduced from na&iuml;ve thinking to a shoddy impression of the television's moral standards.

All I know is that we should give our time and money to charity, because that is the Right Thing To Do.

I'm sitting in my usual position - the rear right corner of the room - and keeping an eye on everyone.  It's a hobby.<br><dd>A student enters.  He's dressed as Casual Man: a very clean white shirt tucked into a pair of very clean fatigue shorts, a pair of battered Birkenstock sandals, and a conspicuous absence of socks.  He's moving to his own rhythm, bopping to an internal beat, arms swinging, head bobbing. He reminds me of a character from an Asian rendition of "Fat Albert."<br><dd>He selects a front row corner seat, and begins an elaborate ritual of settling himself.  He jerks his head violently at the professor, puts on a big open-mouthed grin, and gives a "Hey."<br><dd>Class begins.  We're discussing Ion, a Plato dialogue in which Socrates assaults a professional reciter of Homeric poetry.  Through the course of the dialogue, Socrates proves to Ion that he is an empty shell of a man, incapable of thought or imagination.  Socrates presents his argument in a complimentary fashion, so as to lead the thick-headed Ion to believe he's being praised.  The tone of the entire dialogue is heavily sarcastic. Each of Socrates' pleasantries is a guarded criticism, and Ion is too dense to pick up on it.<br><dd>All of this is painfully evident in the text - it's a basic introduction to the character of Socrates - and is also covered in twenty minutes of lecture immediately following a plot synopsis.  The professor compares Socrates favorably to TV's 'Columbo.'<br><dd>And now, the moment of crisis.  "Okay.  Questions?"<br><dd>I've seen it happen a thousand times.  After two years of languishing in a Computer Science department rife with mediocre minds, I thought I was accustomed to its crippling effects.  I was not prepared, however, for how the magnitude of this infuriating display of the ignorance of my peers would be blown to gross proportions in the Comparative Literature department.<br><dd>One of the major reasons I made the switch from CompSci to CompLit in the first place was that the CompSci people at my fine university rather discourage independent thought.  I was unhappy with this arrangement.  I felt that a program of broader scope and more intelligent focus would better suit me.  "At least," I thought, "the CompLit people will be more interesting than these bores."<br><dd>But the bizarre nature of my new department (which encompasses both Plato and Spider-Man, D.H. Lawrence and Jellyroll Morton) seems to have a less-than-desirable effect on many of its students.  It begins when they realize that more is expected of their brains than ever before.  Instead of rising to the challenge, they become intimidated by their professors and their coursework.  They rely not on their own cerebral resources, but rather on a unique sort of doublethink - an ability to plagiarize the ideas of a writer or a professor and accept them as original, without any conscious knowledge of the plagiarism.<br><dd>Which brings us back to this feeble discussion.<br><dd>The room is silent for a minute.  The professor prods us.<br><dd>"Why does Socrates see fit to utterly debase poor Ion?  Why is that his business?"<br><dd>We all realize that we're each supposed to prove our minds worthy in this situation.  It's a silent competition.<br><dd>A girl sitting next to me tries her hand.<br><dd>"Well, I think that Socrates was being pretty sarcastic the entire time he was talking to Ion.  It's sort of like...  a... well, I can't remember the word for it, but it's when somebody gives you a compliment, but it's not really a compliment, it's more like they're insulting you.  I think it's called a 'downturn compliment,' or something.  But that's what it's like."<br><dd>She's done?  That's all she's going to say?<br><dd>Another girl joins her.<br><dd>"Yeah, I think that's right.  Like when at the end, Socrates asks him if he's divine, or if he's a cheater.  I think he's being sarcastic there."<br><dd>The professor is taking all of this surprisingly well.<br><dd>"Yes, that's true.  But <I>why</I> does Socrates do this?  Why does he tear this guy to pieces?"<br><dd>The late entry - that shuffling, jiving student - speaks up.<br><dd>"You know at the beginning, when Socrates tells Ion that he likes his clothes?"<br><dd>"Yes.  Sets the tone for the rest of the dialogue.  Socrates, in his tattered clothing and without shoes, tells Ion he admires the rhapsody's finery, even though Socrates puts so much emphasis on the virtue of poverty."<br><dd>"Right.  Well, after that, Ion says he's the best reciter in the world, and then I think Socrates got mad that Ion wasn't polite when he got the compliment and so Socrates just made fun of him for that."<br><dd>I am writhing in my seat, and I can see that the professor is doing the same.  Perhaps he is struggling with the same question that I am: is it nobler to parrot a teacher's lecture for sure-fire analysis, or to think things through oneself and completely miss the point?<br><dd>Either way, they're all stupid.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><center><hr width = 400><br><B><font size = +1>What I Learned In Just Twenty Minutes of Television</B></font size><br> <hr width = 400><br></center><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>1) Throwing Sundae Parties with a certain brand of ice cream will make me successful in my career, athletics, and my social life<p>2) A certain candidate for Massachusetts Attorney General is backed by the Massachusetts State Police Force<p>3) The other candidate for Massachusetts Attorney General is backed by the Massachusetts State Police Force<p>4) My local franchise of a nation-wide chain of pharmacies cares about my personal well being<p>5) The New Rock Revolution is led by Bush, the Dave Matthews Band, Hole, and Fastball<p>6) I can buy a collar that will end my problems with fleas and ticks<p>7) Lawyers are bad<p>8) Other lawyers are good, and will get me free money if I have been injured on the job<p>9) One candidate for the United States Senate really <I>is</I> a liberal<p>10) If I miss the season premiere of a certain popular television show, I will be cast off into the fires of Hell, where I will spend eternity in the utmost suffering<p></multicol><br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><center><hr width = 400><br><I>"Michael Douglas is a Hollywood veteran."<br>-overheard</I></B></font size><br> <hr width = 400><br></center><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/shirkn.html"> Other Shirk'n'Shout Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/et.html">Eric Thomas</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
