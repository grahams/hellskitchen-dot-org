It's also a great practical joke to play on your vegetarian friends.<p>Supplies:<UL><LI> A double boiler <LI> A muffin tin<li> Muffin papers</UL><p>Ingredients:<UL><LI> 12 oz. of milk chocolate<LI> 24 slices of pepperoni<li> 4 Tablespoons of Butter</UL><p><dd>Simply melt the chocolate and the butter in the double boiler and then pour in each muffin pod just enough chocolate to coat the bottom.  Place a stack of 3 slices of pepperoni in each.  Allow to cool for a few minutes.  Cover with remaining chocolate.  Chill and serve. Yields 8 Cuperoni's.<p>Variations:<br> 1) Replace pepperoni with other ready-to-eat salted meats (such as cappacola or beef jerky.)<br>2) Sprinkle crushed raw Ramen&#153; noodles or Chex&#153; cereal or Bacos&#153; on top for crunch.<p><I><dd>Frenchman: "Hey, you got your pepperoni in my chocolate!"<br><dd>Italian: "You got your chocolate on my pepperoni!"<br><dd>Announcer: "Two great tastes that were never meant to be together."</I><p><dd>But I say they were!  The two flavors are perfect counterpoint to each other.  If you don't believe me, next time you order a pepperoni pizza, snag a couple of the toppings off and eat them with a bit of a Hershey's bar.  It's not quite the same as the recipe above, because cooked pepperoni is crunchy and greasy.  But try it, and you'll say:<p>"Oh well, it'll do."<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/snack.html"> Other Sir Snacks in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
