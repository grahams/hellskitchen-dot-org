Leave it to the wonderful folks at film distribution companies to either show you too much, leaving you with nothing to see in the theater, or too little, slanted in such a way that the plot of the preview is entirely different than the plot of the film (see "Trainspotting").  "Ronin" was more like the first type.  In the previews, you see Robert DeNiro being all Robert DeNiro in a film - gruff, manicured, smarter, and more important than all the other cast members. And they make the word "Ronin" sound so profound (it is a term that refers to masterless Samurai warriors who become mercenaries and thieves) in the previews, when they mention the word once or twice in the film.  Granted, they introduce the term with a profound story, and oh-so-powerful subtext, and even little miniature warriors set up on a mock battlefield. Naturally, the film is meant to be an allegory for the ancient Ronin experience; Cold War intelligence operatives chase after a briefcase for money.  What's inside the briefcase, you may ask.  I can't tell you that. I can tell you that they picked the right actors.  Just about every person in the supporting cast has secret ties to various governments from previous films they've been in.  Starting with Jean Reno (Krieger from "Mission Impossible", Victor the Cleaner from "La Femme Nikita", and lest we not forget Leon from "The Professional") as a French agent, Sean Bean (Trevelyan from "Goldeneye", Sean Miller from "Patriot Games") as a weapons expert, Stellan Skarsg&auml;rd (Captain Tupolev from "The Hunt for Red October") as a KGB agent, Jonathan Pryce (Elliot Carver from "Tomorrow Never Dies") as a IRA terrorist, and Michael Lonsdale (Hugh Drax from "Moonraker") as a retired French agent.  Wow.  At least they got people with credentials.  Most of them have done a Bond move somewhere along the line.  Unfortunately, this didn't seem to help the film much, which despite innovative car-chase scenes and a high order of cloak-and-dagger routines, became more and more bothersome as it went on.  I can only offer suggestions as to how it could have been made better:<p><dd>1.  There was no big, burly, exceedingly large-in-yo-face-yet- teddy-bear- cuddly black guy, such as Ving Rhames playing an expert of some kind.  Filmmakers today are forgetting the need for "token black guy" in a film.  Speaking of which, why not have the briefcase from "Pulp Fiction" as the coveted object?  Then you could bring back Vincent and Jules, and put them in France so they can order Quarter Pounders with Cheese.<br>   <dd>2.  Too much coffee.  Not that you can have too much, but come on!  This is supposed to be a high-tech thriller, not some advertisement for espresso bars on the Rivera, or that little coffee shop in Paris, remember?  With that waiter, oh what was his name................JEAN-LUC!!<br><dd>3.  The word Glock.  I find that films that use the word Glock are much better films than those that don't.  Don't believe me?  Just watch Die Hard 2, which uses the word Glock, and then watch Die Hard 3, which does not.  DeNiro has a chance to spout off about gun preference and how he just "loves my Glock", but says Colt .45 instead.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have seen Billy Dee Williams, and Robert DeNiro is no Billy Dee Williams!<br><dd>4.  Where was the fucking?  Excuse me, I believe I went to an "R" rated film.  Not even a bloody, exposed  breast from a car wreck.  Hello, sex sells?  I think that's written somewhere, like maybe THE BIBLE!  Thou shalt use Sex and Violence in thine films, for they shalt selleth thine films to thine mass audiences...<br><dd>5.  Ritual Suicide.  When the whole "Ronin" mystique is revealed, they talk about how all the Ronin warriors committed ritual suicide after the battle was won.  So I was kinda expecting at least one of the characters to slice himself open and remove his or her intestines at the end of the film.  Hell, I would have been content just to see it if it came at the credits, like "Yeah, the movie is over, but here's Jean Reno disemboweling himself for your viewing pleasure.  Thank you, come again."  I would have cheered.<p><dd>In conclusion, go see "Ronin" if you like to say the word Ronin around your friends, then comment on how the movie got the definition of Ronin wrong.  If you are an anime freak, a wargamer, or a member of any other socially-inept underground sexless subculture that lives for movies with "Ronin" somewhere in the title, you will no doubt enjoy it.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
