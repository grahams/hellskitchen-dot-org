I began perusing the black and white masterpiece, and I wasn't two sentences into the first article when I realized that it was another article about sex. This, of course, enticed me to read on to find out what fascinating quirk about sex the writer chose to dwell upon, and found myself reading the article with in actual sense of interest. After all, being a male in this world I am forever cursed to want to find out the latest way to break into the female psyche, even though we all know that it isn't possible.<br><dd>I finished the article and felt that I had accomplished something, even though I probably could have learned more reading the side panel of a cereal box. I turned to the next page and began reading the article on it, and what's that one about: sex! Looking at the next, big surprise: sex! When did GDT become an episode of Friends? Then I realized that it's GDT and it's always been this way, sex with an occasional interlude of chess or movies (same thing).  Don't misunderstand me, I read every word in that publication, because it was all about sex. My point? If it hasn't been said in the last 30 seconds: people like sex. Movies, music, advertisements, presidents, it's all about sex in one way or another. We all watch ER because we think George Clooney is hot, and Titanic? C'mon, Leo definitely is the master of all styles.  Whether or not we admit it, people are inspired, driven, motivated, and destroyed all by sex. Blast evolution and her wiley ways! You see, here is the part where I'm supposed to start blaming the usual evils such as the media (what the hell is The Media anyway?), the oppressive religious right (ORR), our parents, and anyone else that happens to come to mind at the time. Well, here's who I blame: me. I blame myself for looking twice at a McDonald's ad with a naked woman on it, for renting Butt Bongo Fiesta the day it came out (what a flick!), for searching the web for some good ol' porn, et cetera. When you get right down to it, we don't like sex because our Catholic High School teachers told us it was the vice of the devil, or because Calvin Kline tells us it's good, or because Peter Gabriel tells us to ("It is supper, it is eggs, it is inbetween your legs..."). We like it because we like it. Since this country is driven by supply and demand, we demand sex so that's what the collective They supply us with. And in convenient Ziploc&trade; packages too! It's amazing just how much sex permeates our society, but what in the hell does it all mean? Does anyone really know or care what, if anything, sex means below the surface? Hell, if you're like Joe College Guy you've joined the Youth Of America in their hatred of religion, standards, and, for the most part, emotions. For some reason, you're supposed to lose all of your emotions and feelings once you pass the age of 12 or so. You're supposed to believe that sex is an act of procreation, that love is "...biochemically no different that eating large amounts of chocolate..." (ah, Al, where are you now?). You have to accept the fact that if you want any sort of sexual relationship with someone, it's going to be for exactly 24 hours, no more. A teacher of mine once said, "Every generation thinks that they were the first people in the history of humanity to discover sex." Of course, hearing the s-word coming out of the mouth of our female teacher made all of us giggle (hey, it was Junior High, what do you want? Alright, it was last week). But it's true, why does a father protect his daughter from the world? Because he used to <I>be</I> the world, and he knows what happens in it, so he makes sex out to be a sin tantamount to the betrayal of Christ. Sex in fact <I>was</I> the Last Temptation of Christ (see previous Peter Gabriel reference), according to the movie. Likewise, every person has the realization of why should sex be limited to male-female (similar to the realization that "That goes in <I>there</I>?!") And when we realize this, it's like we just tasted the forbidden fruit, even though it had been discovered centuries ago.<br><dd>There's nothing that can be done to turn sex back into an act of love, especially since half the readers of this are rolling their eyes right now chanting, "Ack! Morality! Help help, I'm being oppressed!" But I can hope that there's at least one person left in this world that thinks sex actually has some meaning attached to it. Somewhere within the leather clad, dominating, co-depending, insecure, inadequite world there has to be a person left who doesn't see sex as an act unto itself. I guess I'll just have to keep depending on GDT to supply me with the latest information on sexual research, keep devouring the "How to Get Chicks..." articles and believe the myth that girls are looking for someone sensitive instead of someone with a 12 inch dong. The right one's got to be out there somewhere, but if she exists, she's probably a lesbian anyway.<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top align = right> -Dave Klint</td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
