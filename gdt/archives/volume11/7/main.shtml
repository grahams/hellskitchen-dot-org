If you haven't been keeping up with your advent calendar, it's that time of year again. Yup, just when you've taken all the decorations down, packed away all the electric lights, and finally tucking away the limited edition Gustav Mint ash-globe<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> from the last Genocide Day, it's back again. Well, time to hang all the cardboard cut-outs of smiling settlers firing blunderbusses at fleeing natives.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images7/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Oh, wait.... My mistake. It's not Genocide Day at all. It's Columbus Day. Hooray!<br>Kids:<br><dd><I>Christopher Columbus /<br><dd>killed a lot of injuns /<br><dd>In fourteen hundred and ninety two...</I><br><dd>Instead of talking about obscure history, however, this year I'd like to take some current events and throw them back to you with a mooreeffoc<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> spin. So, no sailing saints, no banished Welsh princes, no navigating eunuchs, and certainly no Rock Chewing Vikings.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a><br><dd>Before I really rip into it, I'd like to get overtly political for a moment (as opposed to the subtle politicality that is GDT's reason-d'&ecirc;tre) and talk about the United States government's treatment of Native American tribes.<br><dd>In the 1970's the Supreme Court said what everyone already knew from practice: Indian Nations are sovereign to the extent that the United States government allows them to be sovereign. Translation? If they've got it and we want it, it sucks to be them. And here we are, the nation that likes to think that we are the shining city on the hill, setting an example for all the nations of the world.<br><dd>That having been said, I'd like to present a newspaper article from an alternate history that I asked the Cronos and Clotho Corps (subsidiaries of Hell Inc.) to dredge up from fall of 1838.<p><center><IMG align = center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images7/1.2.gif"><p></center><B>Washington, United States of America:</B> British envoy John Peel today relayed a message to United States President Andrew Jackson to the effect that time is rapidly running out to avoid British and Prussian naval strikes by complying with demands to end an offensive against ethnic American separatists.<br.<dd>While top British, French, and Prussian officials declined to call it Jackson's last chance to avoid attack, British Prime Lord Melbourne warned that "time is all but gone'' for a peaceful settlement in the Cherokee Nation. John Peel held new talks with Jackson today.<br><dd>Divisions remained among the nations of Europe regarding the use of force, however. Spain and Lithuania, among others, are reluctant to proceed without a stronger legal basis for action.<br><dd>At a meeting in Brussels today, the European leaders searched for an adequate legal basis for such strikes.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a>They decided that none was needed.<br><dd>Hundreds of people have been killed, and upwards of 300,000 have been driven from their homes and forcefully relocated since Jackson launched a June 27 crackdown against the ethnic American tribe of Cherokee.<br><dd>Jackson has defied European orders to withdraw substantial forces from the soverign Cherokee nation, maintaining the troops are needed to prevent new attacks by "red savage terrorists" and allow white settlers to move in and get "the yellow metal that makes them craaa-zy."<br><dd>Recalling the United States' "Manifest Destiny" and the Monroe Doctrine, Andrew Jackson stressed that "the Indian issue is the internal affair of the United States, and the threat to use force would constitute an act of war and a threat to our sovereignty."<br><dd>Peel, who arrived from London where he met with officials of the major royal families of Europe, said today that movement toward authorizing the use of force by the allied British and Prussian military continues "in a sustained and intense manner. We're talking serious pain for the Yanks if they don't back down."<br><dd>"Bad shit is going to go down no matter whether we act or not," he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with Jackson in five days. "Either we step in and do a dance on the Americans, or the Americans keep flaying the Cherokee."<br><dd>The international demands Peel was presenting to Jackson included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces from the area of the Cherokee Nation.<br><dd>In addition, Peel was expected to press for an international monitoring force to oversee compliance, and for the Americans to develop a fuller appreciation for Pushkin, and acknowledge the fact they are not a major world power.<br><dd>"We fought a war of independence to keep foreign troops from being able to commandeer our homes and resources. In no fashion will the United States of America allow any `monitoring force' on its soil. We wiped our ass with King George III-twice I might add- and have little fear of doing the same with the bitch [Queen Victoria] and her Prussian lackies."<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images7/1.3.gif"><br><dd>In a move meant to end help bring an end to American agression, the Cherokee Nation announced that they would stop reading and writing effective immediately, a move that will add to the pressure on Jackson to reciprocate. There were no immediate reports of new gunfire, name-calling, or book reading.<br><dd>Jackson has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even though there has been no major fighting in the Cherokee nation during the past week and the Cherokee have been largely killed, raped, marched into the desert West, and generally routed. He considers the Cherokee "savages, terrorists, funny looking bandits, and on prime land that our good white folk want'' and that any cease-fire on his part would legitimize them as human.<br><dd>Citing the Cherokee crisis and European threats of intervention, the United States government today put into effect a harsh decree tightening control over other Indian nations.<br><dd>The decree broadens government authority and envisions punishment for Indians, institutions and individuals who act too uppity, smart, or are in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><dd>Dismissing any talk of a rift within Europe, Peel said he thinks Europe will agree on an activation order "in the next few days" that would authorize an attack.<br><dd>"And even if there is a rift within Europe, it wouldn't amount to much anyway. Every royal family is related to every other family. It's not like the Prussians are going to start a major war some day."<br><dd>Jackson's spokesman, General Winfield Scott, babbled Thursday that European threats were a "rapist act" and went against the Monroe Doctrine...which no nation ever signed, but didn't challenge because they just didn't care.<br><dd>The Europeans are warning that they envision not just one strike against the United States but a series of gradually escalating naval attacks.<br><dd>"By God, we'll give them the licking we should have [in 1812]", Queen Victoria of the British Empire is reported to have said.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> "SPECIAL ASH-GLOBE recreates the carrion-seeded skies of 1941 Dusseldorf when shaken vigorously!
