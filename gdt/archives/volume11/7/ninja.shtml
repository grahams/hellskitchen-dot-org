Jeremiah Parry-Hill had nothing to do with this article. Nothing. I remember otherwise, but he swears he contributed nothing. Nada. Zip. He was just using up our local oxygen supply, adding to our local mass, and generally taking up space. In summary: he's innocent, so stop hounding him!</font size><p><br></td></tr></table>

My demons awaken, demanding fulfillment. The waitress tells me the food will be here soon, but it is already far too late. Hunger burns like sulfur at my center. I lose myself in the hyper-perception brought by this holy fire. The color of blood begins to edge in from the perimeter of my vision.<br><dd>With orange stealth, I silently slide to the floor, disappearing under the stains of the deflowered table cloth. From my new perspective the well-fed ankles flash like fleshy marble pillars. Rockports impede me; I bite ankles clad in blue nylon socks. I pass sneakers, briefly lose myself in the color. I can hear the humming now. It is incessant, driving. I feel the presence of my only friend. He is near, just past the barrier of myself. I cannot make out his speech.<br><dd>I creep to the walls, targeting the lights first. One at a time, I shatter the bulbs. Carefully compressed foil missiles are my projectiles; a straw is my blowgun. Darkness brings the aid to any hunt: confusion. I follow the meatiest scent. I weave as a weasel among table legs. My breath comes evenly. I've stopped blinking. My right leg is giving me trouble, shaking. I find no need to see; everything is clear. With my awareness at full tilt, I reach over the back of the booth. I seize my prey by her loose and flabby jowels. I deliver the silent death. Her companions are still lost in the sudden darkness, remaining oblivious. I grab my prize and feast quickly, without joy. The pickle's texture disturbs me. Lost in the heady ecstasy of the predator, I move on. I've passed through the ducts and I'm invisible long before police appear.<br><dd>I return home, warm and pickle-sated. I perform the appropriate rituals. My friend is pleased, his love warms me.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writers:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br> 	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/mjw.html">Mathew J.
