We've got some great stuff planned for this time around. As you probably remember, last year we started writing music reviews of some of the coolest new CDs, in our opinion, which most of you would otherwise have never heard of. This year, we'll have two reviews each week, just like last year. You'll be able to hear this music at WITR 89.7, since we both have connections there. Also, our website, at http://www.servtech.com/~pinewood/plugged is completely reworked, giving you a much better and more attractive site. We are proud to be announcing the first plugged contest: tell us what you think about our column and get free CDs and other stuff. Want more info? Contact us. Our contact information is at the end of the column. Join us for another great year.<br> <dd>On to the reviews:<p><center><hr width = 150><br><B>Bauhaus - Crackle </B><hr width = 150></center><p><dd>   Bauhaus has been resurrected!  (yes, Bela Lugosi is still dead.)  With the reforming and returning to touring, Beggar's Banquet has compiled a best-of compilation, Crackle, and reissued "Swing the Heartache".<br> <dd>Bauhaus originated in 1978 and disbanded in 1983. They continue to be influential and legendary. Crackle is a glimpse at their catalogue, and is an excellent introduction to this renowned group.<br>       <dd>Bauhaus consists of Peter Murphy (vocals), Daniel Ash (guitar), David J (bass), and Kevin Haskins (drums and percussion). After the bands break up, Peter Murphy went on to have a solo career, while the other three members formed Tones On Tail and Love & Rockets. One way or another, these men have continued to influence the music you hear. Peter Murphy possesses an amazing voice that is illuminated by all of these songs. Daniel Ash and David J create evocative soundscapes, from a wall of noise to petite lines, to coaxing out the most unexpected noises. Bauhaus recorded four studio albums, two live albums, two videos, and five compilations. Although crackle consists of sixteen legendary songs and is a wonderful introduction, I would still recommended finding the original studio albums.<br>       <dd>Crackle is a strong compilation in comparison to some of the best of's and failed tribute albums. There are 16 songs, including the original version of "Bela Lugosi's Dead," which was only released as a 12" single in 1979. Bauhaus have their own style that varies with each album, and each song. For example, they do a punk/industrial version of David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust," then haunting ethereal tracks such as, "The Passion of Lovers,"  "She's In Parties," and "Hollow Hills."  "Terror Couple Kill Colonel" captures the post- punk feel with a blast of noise and distortion. "Double Dare," "In The Flat Field," "Dark Entries," and  "The Sanity Assassin" all contain early experimentation, a wall of noise, with guitar moans, loops, and various distortion. Peter Murphy can be said to still possess a very powerful and organ like vocals. His voice and their musicianship create a unique being that is Bauhaus. All sixteen tracks hold up well regardless of the fact that most were written over a decade ago.<br>      <dd>Bauhaus still continues to have a vital, influential, and important role in music history. Some call them the "founding fathers of goth." In fact, it can even be said that almost all goth bands, industrial bands, art-rock bands, and any other introspective, dressed-in-black bands borrow from or build upon what Bauhaus has accomplished in their short, defining history. Crackle is a fine glimpse into their collection of brilliant work. "Pure sensation, the beautiful downgrade, going to hell again." Going to hell never sounded so good.<br><center>-Justine</center><p></td><td width = 250 valign = top><center><hr width = 150><br><B>The David Arnold James Bond Project - <br>Shaken and Stirred </B><hr width = 150></center><p><dd>      Is it true that only a devout James Bond fanatic would flip over another CD of reworked James Bond themes? Apparently, not. This album, Shaken and Stirred, seems quite apt. Not only have the traditional arrangements been tastefully shaken and stirred, but so has the music industry by this remarkable album. Although it has not enjoyed much success (at least on this continent), the industry is apparently abuzz about this jewel. It has launched the Propellerheads into worldwide fame, convinced Iggy Pop to croon, reminded the world that Chrissie Hynde still kicks ass, and provided (British band) Pulp fanatics (yes, fellow Americans, there are many over there) with a new track to listen to. The original orchestrations and arrangements are used, but reworked, remixed, and added to. This album has reminded me that, with talent, electronica and orchestra can be mixed tastefully and with incredible results.<br>       <dd>The album opens with "Diamonds Are Forever," as performed by the British singer David McAlmont, who turns this classic into a drag queen gem worthy of the song title. This is the best track on the album. Then, Aimee Mann sings "Nobody Does It Better," which mixes the rich, thick electronica with ... a sitar. After this song's long and tiring ending, Leftfield takes the stage with their ambient techno rendition of "Spacemarch."  "All Time High," while not Pulp's best work is still catchy and soaring. A lush, beautiful, "Moonraker," as performed by Shara Nelson follows this. LTJ Bukem, unfortunately, provides the only letdown of the album with "The James Bond Theme," ironically enough. The album quickly redeems itself, though. Chrissie Hynde (from the Pretenders) reworks Paul McCartney's "Live and Let Die" with more class than the original and more power and edge than the classic Guns `n Roses cover. It is loud fast, hard-hitting and intense. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she's back.<br><dd>Then, all becomes quiet. There is a quiet piano solo that rolls, like a wave when joined with the orchestra, into the classic "Thunderball," as performed by Martin Fry. This ties with "Live and Let Die" as the second coolest song on the album. The orchestra and the rock band fuse seamlessly here. Natacha Atlas, who has achieved solo success and success with the band Transglobal Underground, gives "From Russia with Love" a distinctly Middle Eastern/North African flavor. The last two tracks on the album, while both incredibly cool, seem to define the album. The first is the Propellerheads' orchestral remix of "From Her Majesty's" Secret Service." The second is Iggy Pop's surprising "We Have All the Time In The World." The first is an instrumental remix of the orchestra playing the famous piece. This song seems to exemplify David Arnold's intent in gathering these musicians and producing this album. It is the event in which a modern group interprets a classic song. In this case, however, the classic is an instrumental, orchestral piece and the reworker is a famous British Big Beats duo (slightly similar to the Chemical Brothers or Apollo 440). The result is a startling blend of electronica and orchestra, fused seamlessly together. Iggy Pop's surprising performance of "We Have All the Time In The World" seems to exemplify another aspect of this album: he doesn't scream, he sings. And he sings well. This album gives new voices to established musicians, and, likewise, to established classic songs. David Arnold should be commended for his effort. He produced and arranged almost every track on the album, even playing in some. His efforts and the efforts of the brilliant musicians he worked with on this album.<br><center>-Mike</center><p><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><B>Plugged</B> is a weekly music column written by Mike Grandner (mg005g@uhura.cc.<br>rochester.edu) and Justine Grey (jb0012f@uhura.cc.rochester.edu), bringing you informative, informed reviews of the best new music that you've probably never heard of.
