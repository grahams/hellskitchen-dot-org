Torn fishnet stockings. Cutoff shorts.  A torn T-shirt. She had close-cropped, platinum blonde hair, a face too white to be natural, bright red lipstick, and tiny curls penciled on to her temples with eyeliner. She was a Goth poster child.<br>  <dd>"Actually, I'm meeting my boyfriend."<br>    <dd>"Oh, yeah?  Is he a creature of the night, too?"<br> <dd>I could tell she was enjoying the attention to her fashion sense.<br>    <dd>"In so many words.  I met him at a vampire role-playing party."<br>    <dd>Groan.<br>    <dd>"Oh?  Did he convert you, or whatever?"<br>    <dd>"No, I asked him to join a little love session I was having with my girlfriend."<br>    <dd>Wow, a sexually liberated Goth!  This was getting interesting.  Most gothic teen-agers I had met (a gothic adult is just too terrible to imagine) had basically been regular people, plus make-up and a starved libido.  Most of them hang out at the mall in Marilyn Manson t-shirts, pathetically asking innocent mallgoers for cigarettes.  Take away the music and the fashion sense, but keep the level of social maturity, and you've got your average AD&D player.  (No offense to AD&D players is intended.)<br> <dd>Throw in some blurred gender roles, though, and you're guaranteed to freak everyone out, even other Goths (who will pretend not to care).<br>  <dd>Freaking everyone out is, of course, the goal.  Palm it off as self-expression, if it makes you feel better.  I, personally, can't help wondering why so many of these outcasts are expressing themselves with the same wardrobe.  Or why they became outcasts in the first place - was it the talent for writing pretentious poetry, or the competitive spirit that drove them to become to the gothiest Goths they could be?<br><dd>Where did Goths come from?  Why are they here?  What can be their purpose in this Great Society&#153;?<br><dd>The boyfriend approached us, giving me a menacing look.  Picture Robert Smith with five times the make-up, forty extra pounds, and baggy black jeans. I could tell who was leading who around by the testicles.  Robert Deluxe was definitely unhappy to see me, but knew he couldn't say anything without risking a bitch-slap from his Meisterfrau.<br>   <dd>"Well, I've gotta get out of here.  See you in class."<br>    <dd>I pointed a suave finger, in the tradition of the great Telly Savalas.<br>    <dd>"Not if I see you first, baby."<br>    <dd>Sir Robert gave me a look that, if Goths really had the immortal power of the vampire, surely would have turned me to dust.<br>    <dd>I learned an important lesson that day.  I learned that despite the professed sexual liberation and the counter-culture aspirations, gothic children live by the same rules as the rest of us.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><center><hr width = 400></center><br> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><B>Normal Rule:</B> Have as much sex as possible.<br> <B>Gothic Rule:</B> Have as much sex as possible, but make it spooky.<br><B>Normal Rule:</B> Do not let others horn in on your racket.<br><B>Gothic Rule:</B> If others horn in on your racket, put an ancient curse on them.<br><B>Normal Rule:</B> Don't talk about your bodily functions, because others don't want to hear about them.<br> <B>Gothic Rule:</B> Don't talk about your bodily functions, because others shouldn't know that you have any.

It's nice to see that no matter how much someone screams at us that they're different, no matter how loudly they preach, they've got the same American boundaries as the rest of us.<br>    <dd>Take the Deadheads, for example.  Before Jerry Garcia's death in August of 1995 (an event that basically smashed the Dead scene into tiny Day-Glo pieces), the Heads had their own world view, parallel to any other. They had their protagonist (the Heads themselves), the antagonist ("straight" society, or "Babylon"), their gods (Jah, Mother Earth), and their rhetoric (quit your job, Jah will provide).<br>    <dd>Their chief weapon against Babylon was an altered sense of time.  Their lives were punctuated not by the routines of school and career, but by musical and hallucinogenic interludes.  They ran on a different schedule, which separated them from straight life.<br><dd>The truth has been realized by more than one Deadhead in fleeting moments of lucidity.  The important thing about the Dead scene was that it was a small-scale model of the rest of American society.  That's why so many elder Deadheads were proud to be "American Hippies," and not a bunch of stupid European or East Asian Hippies.<br>    <dd>The younger ones were a bit misguided. They didn't understand who they were rebelling against.  They figured that it must be America, because that was the first target that came to mind.  It's easy to rebel against a country, because the country makes the laws, and the laws prevent you from doing what you want to do (i.e. drugs).<br>    <dd>America provided the endless road for the Deadheads to travel upon. America provided the spirit of freedom, and the pursuit of individuality. America provided the drug culture roots of the Grateful Dead - Ken Kesey, the Acid Tests.  All the Deadheads provided were the buses.<br>    <dd>They showed up in numbers and proportions that did not present a cross-section of ideal American life; they showed up in numbers and proportions that presented a cross-section of the Real American Life.  They were young and white, from middle class backgrounds.  They were the ones that could afford the meager expenses of cheap transportation and food.  They were the ones without roots - without families to feed, without bills to pay.<br>    <dd>They went on tour, and they grew old.  Some raised children on tour. Most had no friends outside the tour, in Babylon.<br><dd>And, when Jerry died?<br>    <dd>"They all went on Phish tour," answers a Housemate.<br><dd>True, many did.  But not nearly all of them.  Most of the older Heads were left without homes.  They tried to adapt to the smarter, more frenetic Phish scene, but failed when the music and the people just got _too_ weird.<br><dd>"Well, some of them went on Furthur tour, too," says the Housemate.<br><dd>They lived their lives by the Babylon's rules, whether they will admit it or not.  The big difference is that they based their nomadic lives on the style and movement of one group of musicians. Their entire culture grew up around a single band.  And in that altered sense of time, where the only landmarks are tour stops and drug trips, they failed to consider their future. Or perhaps they refused to see their future.  So they collapsed.  Their experiment in counterculture failed.  One summer, they were talking about a societal revolution.  The next summer, they were dropped back from whence they came - into the Great White Middle Class.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><center>	<IMG  width = 400 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol11/images7/shirkn.gif"><br></center><center><hr width = 400></center><br><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>There was a time when I was actually rooting for the Deadheads and the Goths.  Wouldn't it be funny if the Goths really were vampires and the Heads actually staged a revolution?  Life would be interesting, anyway. Picture a bunch of white-faced, black-cloaked teenagers twirling in the streets to bluegrass music at midnight.<br><dd>It was all for fun, though.  After a while, that idealism collapses. Mainstream society doesn't look so bad anymore.  Those nomads and misfits have to get jobs.  Throw them in the Deviant Processing Machine and press the 'Assimilate' button.<br><dd>The tragic part is that these miscreants never get a chance to explore the distractions that they've occupied themselves with.  If I could build my own Deviant Processing Machine, it would be the social equivalent of the Total Perspective Vortex&#153;.  Where the Perspective Vortex shows you the entire universe and your place in it (extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake), my Processing Machine would show you, in shocking Technicolor detail, your complete social surroundings (extrapolated from a Junior Prom invitation).  Toss a Hippie in the machine, and he'll see himself in the middle of a tie-dyed blob labeled 'Heads,' which is in the middle of a gray blob labeled 'America.'  Toss a Goth in, and he'll see the same thing, except he'll be in a black blob labeled 'Goths' (in fancy crimson lettering, incidentally).<br>    <dd>The shocking part is that both blobs appear nestled within that beloved Big Gray Blob, America.  As much as the Goths and the Heads would like to believe that they're outside the protective pseudopodia of the American blob, the truth is that they couldn't exist anywhere else.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><table width = 500><tr><td valign = top><center><hr width = 400><br><I>I yearn for the affection and tenderness that can only be felt between a drill sergeant and his privates.</I></center><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/shirkn.html"> Other Shirk'n'Shouts in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/et.html">Eric Thomas</A><br><font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/authors/mjw.html">Mathew J.
