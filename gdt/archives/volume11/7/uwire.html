Leakey at one time held this position, but Moi fired him for embezzlement in 1994.According to Woodruff, after Western replaced Leakey, he restored the money that Leakey had embezzled by obtaining donations from the World Bank.<br><dd>Woodruff said that Leakey, angered over his termination, sought help in family friend and Moi associate Charles Njonjo. Woodruff also said Njonjo influenced events leading to Western's firing and Leakey's replacement of him. However, traveling in another country, Moi was unaware of this action. Upon returning, Moi had Western reinstated.<br><dd>Four months later, the Kenyan president fired Western and reappointed Leakey as apart of an apparent plan to develop the preserves.<br><dd>"[Western] was caught in the middle of the corruption of Kenyan politics," Woodruff said. "He is a quiet field ecologist. He is an unlikely person to be directing men in government, leading 2000 men in uniform. He knows elephants inside and out. He's devoted his whole life to elephant conservation," Woodruff said.<br><dd>Western is widely known for his efforts to ban trade on the ivory of elephants, an issue now supported by over 80 governments. Western is an adjunct professor of biology here at UCSD, teaching every spring quarter.<br><dd>"[Western] took this job because saving Kenya's wildlife fell to him," Woodruff said. "No one else could do it. His whole personality is colored by his desire to do the right thing for Kenya and its wildlife."<br><dd>Upon his appointment to the directorial position, Leakey told the Reuters news service (Sept. 25) that he was happy to be in his former job again.<br><dd>"I believe that I have an obligation to my country Kenya, and in the hopes that I can indeed be helpful at this time, I have accepted the position of [Kenyan Wildlife Services director]," Leakey said.<br><dd>According to Reuters, Kenya's wildlife parks are facing numerous problems. Due to recent robberies and attacks on tourists, ethnic violence conflicts, and strange weather conditions caused by El Ni&ntilde;o, the park has been severely impacted.<br><dd>This year the park will be posting an operating deficit of more than $8 million (U.S.), compared to $3 million (U.S.) in 1994, when Leakey last held the job.<br><dd>"Kenya's wildlife management is in grave difficulty at the moment," Leakey said. "Poaching for meat, ivory, and other products is on the increase and the [organization] charged with the task of taking care of our wilderness areas is completely broke and cannot do its work."<br><dd>Leakey also told Reuters that the wildlife service will do more to ensure tourist safety in the areas. He said that he and the service must cut its prices, improve its roads, and work on customer relations in order to attract more tourists to the area.<br><dd>The Guardian was not able to reach Western or his wife, Shirley Strum, for comment. The only available means of communication was through e-mails between Woodruff and Strum. Woodruff gave the e-mails to the Guardian and said that Strum intended for them to be released publicly.<br><dd>Strum stated that the Kenyan government tapped their phone lines and removed communications equipment from their home.<br><dd>"People are heartsick, including the rangers who were summarily removed from our house, and the technicians who ripped out the equipment," Strum stated. "Leakey was given three months of security coverage after he left. Njonjo decided [Western] deserved not even one day. That's the level it will sink to."<br><dd>Additionally, Strum wrote that the Kenyan government started a smear campaign in an attempt to ruin Western's reputation. Kenyan papers published pictures of Strum's house in California, implying that Western and his wife had used illegal funding to finance the house. The house belonged to Strum's parents.<br><dd>"The main goal is to discredit and thwart [Western] at every turn and demonstrate to the world that he is a liar and has failed," Strum stated. "The truth is that he nearly successfully accomplished an impossible job under truly impossible conditions.<br><dd>"So many people have said that too much has been built to be reversed," she added. "Those are the people who will now have to fight. Let's hope they have the strength and the courage." <br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume11/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
