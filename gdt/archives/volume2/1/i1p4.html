Afraid that the dead sheep would contaminate drinking water, people fevorishly tried to devise ways of raising the ship. Luckily someone remembered a Disney comic book in which Donald Duck used ping pong balls to raise a sunken ship. So the ship was filled with 27 billion plastic balls and was soon afloat.</font size></td><td align=right valign=top><table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td width=200><center><font size=-1><B>GDT Fan Club</B></center><br>Back issues, tee-shirts, and other neat stuff.<br>For information, contact GDT through:<br><br><A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> or<br>472 French Rd<br>Rochester NY, 14618</font size></td></tr></table></td></table><TABLE  width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=right><P><ADDRESS><font size=-1>Responses and submissions can be sent to:<A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> </font size></ADDRESS></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><ADDRESS><font size=-1>or 472 French Rd, Rochester, NY 14618</font size></ADDRESS></TD></TR></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i1p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br>Previous Issue - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../2/i2p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
