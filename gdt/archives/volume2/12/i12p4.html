She had no idea how long the woman had been holding her there in the window, but her body began to give out from under her and she felt herself falling to the cold damp earth, then darkness.<br><dd>She woke in darkness, not really sure where she was, or what she had been doing before she fell asleep, but the ceiling above her, with its paint pealing, was not familiar to her. She turned her head to the side and at once noticed the head on the table, only now with a single candle burning from inside. The scent of burning flesh filled the room as did the smoke that was slowly seeping out the eyeholes in the skull. A wave of fear struck her as she realized where she was. She tried to sit up, only to discover that she was tied down. She wanted to scream, wanted her parents to come and help her, wanted someone, anyone.<br><dd>Regretting her wish, the lady entered the room and Darla closed her eyes as to pretend to still be asleep. She could hear the lady, but couldn't figure out what it was that she was doing. She wanted to open her eyes, but didn't know if the lady was watching or not. Something of a gut feeling told her to stay as she was and not do anything stupid. She heard the drawers in the cabinet open again, so she dared to peek because the lady was on the other side of the room.<br><dd>The first thing she noticed was the painting above her head, the one she saw earlier. How long have I been here? She wondered to herself. She noticed that the sun was still high in the sky and the clouds had cleared as she gazed out the window with the still torn plastic and the blood stains on the window sill. She turned her head to look at the lady in the shadows, she could see that the lady had taken a knife out of the drawer and was about to close it. She was about to turn her head back, but before she could, she found herself looking once again into those cold gray eyes.<br></TD><td valign=top width=250><dd>     "So, you are awake my dear," the lady said in a sing song voice. "It's much better that wa. Oh the fun we will have. The pain, you will suffer will be such a treat. I want you to scream for me when I cut your flesh, will you do that for mama?"<br><dd>"Stay away from me you bitch," Darla shouted. "Let me go."<br><dd>"Yes," the lady said followed by laughter, "that's what I want you to do, just do it a little louder. Ha Ha Ha Ha..."<br><dd>The lady approached the beat up couch as Darla tried to free herself from this hideous woman. She screamed curses at the lady, only to get more of that insane laughter. As the lady reached the couch, Darla looked into her eyes and pleaded, "Please..." The lady stopped and stared, enjoying the vision of the helpless girl strapped to the sofa, so innocent, so frightened. The look in the girl's eyes was enough to give the lady sheer joy. The lady stood in her tracks with her eyes fixed on Darla's, the minutes faded one by one and the girl was beginning to become paranoid by the silence. She thought that maybe the lady was considering her plea to be released, she hoped.<br><dd>With the knife still clutched in her hand, and the fading daylight flowing through the window, the lady sank to her knees and she began to crawl towards the couch. Her evil grin seemed to whisper, "I'm coming for you dear, I'm coming..."<br><dd>Darla let out another scream from her already sand dry throat as the bony fingers wrapped around her arm. The hand with the knife inches above her forehead, shaking to the rhythm of the lady's unsteady posture. She closed her eyes and willed herself to scream one last time before the blade penetrated her flesh. Like a ghost from her soul, a loud, shrill scream pierced the dusk, echoing in the wind to the distant town where the jack o' lanterns lined the streets, their evil grins, their fiery eyes, insane laughter, combined with the laughter of the children masquerading on the devil's night. <br></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i12p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br><A HREF="../11/i11p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../13/i13p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
