Low and behold, we were caught making a vague comment. We're pleased to present the letter we received correcting our error.<br><dd>On an entirely unrelated note:<br><dd>GDT plans on increasing it's circulation (possibly length) next quarter. This means we can accept more submissions, art, letters, bla, bla, bla (insert diatribe here). In addition, we can add more locations to the regular distribution areas, as well as the special delivery locations. Let us know where you think GDT should show up.<br><dd>Remember: GDT encourages our readers to let us know when our bums are showing.<br><table width=80%><tr><td align=right>-GDT Editors</td></tr></table></td><td><br></td><td valign=top width=260><A NAME="letters"></A>Date: Mon, 30 Oct 1995 11:14:24<br> From: JCF@rit<br> Subject: issue 8<p>   In <A HREF="../10/i10p1.html">volume 2, issue 8</A>( i think that is the issue, it's this weeks GDT), first article, the author attempts to describe space-time.  The author, while not making it overly complicated as promised, i don't think fully explains it.  It would have been better to say that it is akin to making a dent in a trampoline and then rolling a marble toward the edge of the dent.  The deflection of the path is the effect that we see as gravity.  I don't think this complicates things much and gives a more complete understanding of the idea, which is something said author, in said article, complained that there was a lack of  occurring in the layman. (i.e. darwin's theory of evolution and businessmen)<br> That is all    </td></tr><tr><td valign=top colspan=3><font size=+1><B><A NAME="myth"></A>Microscopic Moral Mythology</B></font size><br><table width=35%><tr><td align=right>-Kelly Gunter</td></tr></table><p><I>"Respect Your Elders."</I></br><dd>I also used to hear, "You have to earn respect." Have you ever noticed how these two ideas don't always work well together?<br><dd>People can earn respect through extraordinary abilities, skill, maybe even a strong conviction. Basically, respect is a commodity given when the beholder admires some aspect or aspects of the person receiving that respect.<br><dd>Over the summer I worked with four guys who were all older than I, but I just couldn't bring myself to respect any of them. The youngest spent the whole time asking me to have sex with him, while the other three spent their valuable time bitching, moaning and generally harassing each other. Of those three, all well into their prime or beyond, one was into dramatics and backstabbing, another was into grumbling and paranoia, and the third had it in for his own version of psychological warfare (his idea of reverse psychology was telling some one to do exactly what they wanted them to do).<dd>How, and more importantly why, am I supposed to show people like that respect? Maybe I'm supposed to resect the person and just forget about whatever qualities they may have. But isn't it he those qualities of a person that make up who that person is? If you respect someone not for who they are, but merely just because, isn't that more like showing a respect with no respect?<br><dd>I mean, a lot of people are older than me, it's not as if it takes to much effort to do so. Charles Manson is older than me, am I supposed to respect him for that? It's not as if people are in danger of dying if they're not too intelligent any more, unless they're complete idiots.<br><dd>Maybe I'm just taking this the wrong way. Maybe we should just change the words so we don't get hung up on the semantics of their meanings. It should be, "Respect is earned," and, "Humor you elders."</td>  </tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i13p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i13p3.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../12/i12p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../14/i14p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
