They can go for thirty-five or even one hundred feet, and are usually mistaken for snakes in the undergrowth. People generally make cracks about the comparative slowness of the turtle, but would you move around hastily if everything within a one hundred foot radius was at arm's (or neck's) reach?<br> <dd>     Back in the Middle Ages when men still measured various distances by the lengths of their respective king's body parts, turtles took a decisive role in the invention of the modern tape measure. They used to divvy up turtle's neck into lengths of the current monarch's measurements and then go and use them much as we use tape measures today. They were even better than modern tape measures to some extent because you could clamp their little mouths onto something and then just walk along unreeling the rest of their spine. When you got to the end of whatever you were measuring, all you had to do was just pull on the little bugger's tail until the shock unclamped his head and it would come screaming back towards his little body. Often times these procedures rendered the turtle unconscious, but he'd get over it. The obvious problem with using turtles as tape measures was that whenever they managed to escape into a pond, when you finally retrieved them again, all of their markings were washed off and you had to make another appointment to measure the king.<br> <dd>     Eventually the turtles got fed up with their horrendous treatment and we had what the history books don't mention as the "Snapper Rebellion". In the turtle rebellion, the snappers were the fiercest of all of the turtle warriors and led towards an easily decisive victory over mankind. Since this time most  of the turtles settled down to relative obscurity and keep the vast expanses of their necks hidden in the wind up mechanism within their shells. All that is except the Snapping turtles, who, by the way, do not let it wander to far, but farther than many of their modern counterparts; it's just cocky. Most snapping turtles are still very bitter about the annexation of their post war land settlements and this is why they have the reputation of being the cruelest of turtles, they're still trying to get revenge.<br>	<table><tr><td width=100 valign=top align=right>-BFG</td></tr></table></td><td width=250 valign=top>   <font size=-1><dd> <A NAME="brain"></A> We received the following article from two different sources.
