That's right; for those who didn't know, GDT is paid for entirely by the staff.<dd>Make that was.<br><dd>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre won't be printing anymore issues. Just kidding. We've gotten enough cash from other sources to pay for the rest of the year. In fact, we have so much cash we would like to expand in length and circulation.<br><dd>Though we can't disclose everything we have planned for next quarter and the rest of the year, here are some hints:<br><UL><LI>	Hell Inc. sponsors The Saintly Travel Guide<LI>	A contest.

All writers, artists, or idea people are welcome. And remember, we don't fuck'in censor our work.<br><dd>On another note...<p><dd>Last January, Gracies Dinnertime Theatre tried to start a column in the Reporter. The original three member staff (two writers, one illustrator. You can figure out a little about the GDT logo from that) thought it would would be nice to have a regular humor column in amongst the dryness of the Reporter. Well, we were shot down.<br> <dd>They say that imitation is the greatest complement; thanks Reporter.<br><table width=80%><tr><td align=right>			-GDT</td></tr></table><p> <table width=260><tr><td valign=top><B><font size=+1><A NAME="email"></A>Random Acts of Email</font size></B><br><table width=60%><tr><td align=right>-from Mark Nowak</td></tr></table> <dd>I GRABBED A BOOK FROM THE MAIL ROOM'LIBRARY ABOUT THE OCCULT AND SUPERNATURAL.

Our martyr of the week for Nov. 13-19 is St. Nerses of Armenia. In actuality, the Martyr of the Week should be going to the staff of GDT; the fact that we spent the time to put this issue out during the final week of classes is an act of martyrdom in and of itself. But I digress.... St. Nerses became bishop of Armenia in 363 AD. His encounter with the rulers of this region lead to his eventual martyrdom at the hands of King Pap. Our saint had excommunicated Pap's forerunner for murdering his wife, and when Pap came to power, accused Pap of being possessed by demons. The king protested his innocence of the charge and, to allay fears, invited the bishop to dinner- and poisoned him.<br><dd>Until next time, remember: altar boys do not make good pets (they don't respond to cages very well.
