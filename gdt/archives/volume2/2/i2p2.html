They both function in the same way as well; when a male or female is aroused, their respective organ is engorged with blood, causing them to become erect. Anyway, my point is size. It doesn't take a biologist to understand that a woman's clitoris is smaller than a man's penis...especially when engorged with blood.<br>	<dd>With that extra blood being diverted, overall oxygen arriving to the brain has to decrease, but since a woman's clitoris is relatively smaller than most penises, her brain is receiving more oxygen than a man's.<br>	<dd>So, I guess that in a sense, men really do think with their dicks...or at least it inhibits their thinking.<br></TD></tr><tr><td valign=bottom align=center><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol2/v2i2p2.1.gif"><br><dd>-Brian Revoir</td><td width=420 ><center><B><font size=+2><A NAME="duck"></A>Plastic Lawn Ornament<br> Returns From World Tour</font size></B></center><P><dd>Grapevine, Texas (AP) - The quack is back.<br><dd>And what a vacation it was!<br><dd>A yellow plastic duck that disappeared from the front yard of Jess and Judy Daniel last spring reappeared recently.<br><dd>They'd feared it had fallen victim to a marauding dog, but no.<br><dd>The culprit left a photo album logging the duck's travels to some of the landmarks of Europe and the United States.<br><dd> "I went out to get the paper a few weeks ago, and the duck was back with the photo album beside it," Daniel said.
