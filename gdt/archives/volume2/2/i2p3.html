In fact They&#174; say things about everyone. In the past the corporation which comprises They&#174;, (a world wide organization actually bent on world domination through control of stereotypes, petty gossips, and all communication byways.) was actually in the business of manufacturing products of impeccable quality. They&#174; have relinquished this persuit in order to focus on what They Say&reg;(their actual product), and how They&#174; want people to react to it. Which really is too bad, because as a manufacturing company their products were really top notch.

Just think of all the times you've heard the statement uttered, "You know what They&#174; say..." as if to nod your head and say, instant verificable fact.
