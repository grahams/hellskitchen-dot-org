I mean, we knew that we  enjoyed ourselves, but as for the rest of you, well, we're kind of myopic. All our staff have become GDT junkies, and I don't think we could stop if we tried, so if any of you have become addicted, I think we're going to continue to feed your habit.<br><dd>  Anyway, here are just a few of the messages we've been sent in the last couple of weeks. Enjoy.<br><TABLE  width=40%><tr><td align=right>- GDT Staff<P></td></tr></table><hr><table cellspacing=3><tr><td width=50% valign=top>Date: Sat, 09 Sep 1995 12:33:57<br> From: Hillary R.E.<P>    <dd> Hello, I'm a RIT graduate, and have heard the myths of bare foot girl, and have seen her once or twice. She seems like she would be an interesting person. why didn't you interveiw her? And does she know that she has been featured in your zine? (please ignore this if you have interveiwed her, For I have not checked out the entire issue yet). What I have seen looks good, RIT needs a sense of humor. The layout looks good, I allso like the illustations. I have just finshed designing the home page for jolt cola (www.joltcola.com) check it out if your board.  Well keep up the good work<br>		<dd>-Hillary</td><td width=700 valign=top colspan=2>Date: Sun, 10 Sep 1995 20:56:09<br> From: Bijay<br>Subject: GDT and all<P>     <dd>On my way to brunch today I was given a GDT and I liked reading it. I saw the website tonight while avoiding my homework and thought it was really cool. I want to join the GDT fan club, my folder is in the Applied MAth section the name is Bijay, and I'd see about contributing sometime, I guess email me if you're really desperate and I'd see what I could do. Anyways, keep up the good work, I think it's really neat. Damn Gracie for slowing you down!<br>	<dd>Bijay, an enlightened fan</td></tr></table><td width=200 valign=top>Date: Thu, 14 Sep 1995 16:46:20<br> From: Marc<P>Dear GDT,<br><dd>      I couldn't help but notice that the default Netscape homepage setting for all the Macs was indeed Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre.  So I said to myself, "It must be good if all these other people are reading it."<br>  	<dd>After surfing for a few hours on GDT and missing several unimportant liberal arts classes (senior seminar, etc...), I have come to the conclusion that GDT is in fact a quality publication.  Who am I to judge, you may ask?  Well, just some guy who was bored and got a kick out of GDT.  Since I live and eat in Perkins (apts), I hadn't seen the hard copy version of GDT.<br>     <dd> Anyway, before I miss a third consecutive class, I just thought I'd say that I really enjoyed GDT and will visit often.  I will make a link to it on my (soon to be constructed) homepage.  Keep up the good work and when's the next issue, dammit?<br>	<dd>Marc <P><hr width=50% align=left><dd>All of the fan mail has been appreciated, but we could do with a bit of hate mail. Nothing like matyredom to encourage us. At any rate, if we don't manage to disturb you enough by the end of our next issue, we may just go cold turkey.</td></TR></table></TD></tr></table><TABLE  width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=right><P><ADDRESS><font size=-1>Responses and submissions can be sent to:<A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> </font size=-1></ADDRESS></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><ADDRESS><font size=-1>or 472 French Rd, Rochester, NY 14618</ADDRESS></font size></TD></TR><tr><td align=right><font size=-2>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre reserves the right to reprint <br>any correspondance recieved, without prior editing.</font size></tr></td></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i2p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br><A HREF="../1/i1p1.html">Previous Issue</a> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../3/i3p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
