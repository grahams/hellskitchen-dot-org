And I know I'm gonna burst a few bubbles here, but you guys really can't have one without the other. Life revolves around death, just as death first requires life.<dd>So he stood there in all of his moral supremacy sprouting his holier than thou (or rather holier than me) attitude. He spoke so highly of how he scrutinizes the ground before each step so as not to crush any unsuspecting insects. He didn't seem to pay much attention to the ground as we walked through the park, but I granted him this leniency. <dd>"So, what about the smaller insects, the microscopic parasites in your skin, hair and mouth? Do you even think of all the bacteria you're killing when ever you wash your hands? It shows signs of life. Do you ever consider your effects on microbes that may both help and hinder?" <dd>And of course he couldn't be held responsible for those deaths because he could not see them.<dd>"But you know they're there, don't you?"<dd>And this of course is irrelevant in it's nature.<dd>We sat there, on the edge of a grove of trees, with the soft, persistent hum of the lady mosquito foraging for the life blood sustenance with which to raise her children. Slap! <dd>"Hah! I got you, you little bastard!"<dd>"OK, so let me get this straight. Killing something is wrong under every circumstance for every living creature unless you either can't see the victims or they annoy you."<dd>"That's not fair!"<dd>"But that's how you live isn't it?"<dd>I've heard a lot of people saying that actions are harder than words. I disagree. Actions are pretty damn easy. The tough part is coordinating the two to make sense together.<table align=left width=475 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td align=right><font size=-1>-by Kelly Gunter<P></font size></td></tr></table><p><br><TABLE width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=200 colspan=2><center><font size=+2><B><A NAME="hint"></A>GDT Helpful Hint:</B> <br>Killing people never solves anything, but it keeps people out of your hair while you think of what to do next.</font size></center><P></TD><td rowspan=3 valign=bottom><table border><tr><td><center><font size=+2> <B>GDT Fan Club</B><P></font size>Back Issues, tee shirts, the GDT action figure, and other neat stuff!<br></center>If your on the RIT campus, just e-mail:<br><center><B><A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A></B> <P></center>Else write to:<br><B><dd>GDT<br><dd>472 French Rd<br><dd>Rochester, NY  14618<br></B>Please include a self addressed, stamped envelope and a scrap of paper saying something to the effect of ""Hey!
