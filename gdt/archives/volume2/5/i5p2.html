For two thousand years they have taken that love, without earning it.<dd>Like a insolent child, we have continued in our ways of cruelty and hate, always knowing that unconditional love was there for us. Why work to the best of our ability when we are handed a prize for being wicked?<dd>The time has come to earn that love. Let us end the love of what we could be, and replace it with the love of who we are. Earn God's love and admiration. Demand the highest, not only of yourself, but of others. Dare to take your rightful place beside God; not as a lesser being, but as His equal. Recognize yourself as a Creator in your own right. Take responsibility for who you choose to be and for your actions.</TD><td valign=top><table border><tr><td><center><font size=+2><B>Cutting Connections</B></font size></center><dd>Ever thought of how much money campus connections must be making off buying back your old books and then reselling them?
