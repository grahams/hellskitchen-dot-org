As an African who was born and raised in Africa, who came to the US to study and heard back as soon as my studies are complete, I feel that that article is an insult to my people and I don't understand why it should be put on a paper to be read by the people like me.<p>I feel that who ever wrote that paper and the paper which published it owes me an opology, because I am Zulu and the women who put the rings around their neck Shangani a tribe which is part of the Zulu Nation, The Greatest African nation which ever came together in the rest of Southern Africa. Whether I person who wrote that articles is an African or not I think he or she should know why our women put rings around their necks before he or she writes lies about them which annoy some of us who know better. There are many places today here people can get information about anything. A lot of true Africans are her today to defend their people left and write and that is what everybody should know before they try to talk about us. And for that matter I anm one of those True AFRICANS. You quick respose regarding this letter is awaited.<p>Kabelo Motlaleng (Zulu)</font size></TD><td valign=top width=47%><font size=-1>Date: Tue, 03 Oct 1995<br> From: (Ian Turner)<br>Subject: Volume 4, Issue 4 Gracies Dinnertime Theatre<p></font size><font size=+1> Hi,<p><dd>I was just reading the contents of   <A HREF="../../volume1/4/i4p1.html">Volume 4, Issue 4 Gracies Dinnertime Theatre Sunday March 26, 1995</A> - the article on the barefoot girl.<p><dd>You describe a girl who goes barefoot all the time, even in the snow!  I know someone very similar - they ought to meet.  Can you fill me in on whatit was about.  IS she a real person, and do you know who she is???!!<p>Can you fill me in, much appreciated...<p><dd>-see ya, ian<P></font size><hr width=75%><p><font size=+1><center><B><A NAME="edit"></A>Message from the editors</B></center></font size><br><font size=-1><dd>First, we'd like to take a moment to explain that we don't edit your letters for clarity. The way you send them to us is the way we print them up. So if you want a finished format to your letter, do it yourself before you send them.<br><dd>We appreciate the sentiment from our Zulu friend, and that particular part of our article was not meant to offend. However, we do not feel an apology is truly necessary. We merely referred to the practice on a practical basis, which however culturally significant does not contribute well to the overall functioning of the neck. In China women have been known to bind their feet to keep them small and apparently beautiful, the cultural significance of such a practice does not negate the fact that it is a painful process which malforms the individual's feet.<br> <dd>Frankly, we're kind of surprised at the kind of things that people seem to get offended by. So far we have <A HREF="../3/i3p1.html">supported suicide</A>, <A HREF="../../volume1/6/i6p1.html">anthropophogous activities</A>, the underground <A HREF="../../volume1/14/i14p1.html">human pinata circuit</A>, <A HREF="../../volume1/1/i1p1.html">taping people to the wall for fly paper</A>, and even suggested that <A HREF="../../volume1/6/i6p1.html">Taco Bell now imports dead Mexicans(due to NAFTA) for it's meat supply</A>. Our first issue to spawn hate mail was the one Ian read on the <A HREF="../../volume1/4/i4p1.html">Barefoot Girl</A>. <A HREF="../../volume1/5/i5p2.html#crit">We were compared to the nazi's</a> for it, and here we are blasted for some vague reference to the Shangani tribe. Since we all remain completely ignorant of which buttons offend, we're going to keep pushing all of them.<br><dd>Our letter from Ian Turner came from the UK. Yes Ian, the Barefoot Girl exists, in fact she's one of our head editors and writers. And she enjoys hate mail just as much as the rest of us, it's kind of nice to see when someone opens their eyes, if only for a moment.<br> <dd>Looking forward to pissing you ALL off at some point...<br></font size><table width=75%><tr><td align=right valign=top><font size=-1>-GDT Staff</font size></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i5p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br><A HREF="../4/i4p1.html">Previous Issue</a> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../6/i6p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
