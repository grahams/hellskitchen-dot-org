Let me tell you, we didn't. Not one bit. I HATE pink. Now, I'm sure most of you didn't think anything of it. I talked to someone, and they thought we printed on pink paper on purpose, as a sort of eye catcher. Hell, if we wanted to catch your eye, we'd have the Barefoot Girl handing out issues on the quarter mile dressed only with the strategic placement of two thimbles (but she doesn't seem to want to sign all the release forms necessary). Nope. That pink paper was the result of a screw up made by the printers; a screw-up, I might add, which was made and could not be corrected in time to meet our deadline.</TD></tr></table><table width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td><dd>After many stress filled minutes as the editors shouted at one another in an attempt to make things right through sheer decibels, we swallowed our pride and decided to go with the (uuuggh) pink prints, because twenty six dollars worth of reprinting is a lot harder to fit down the gullet on a full stomach than our pride is. We know most of you didn't know it was a screw up, but we did. Believe it or not, we do have a certain level of quality that we adhere to. Sure, our grammar can be questionable at times, and there is at least one type-o in each issue, but we are not sloppy, not like that anyhow. So this week's Microscopic Moral Mythology is dedicated to Mediocrity:<p><dd>Ever just done something to get it done? Then you've been the victim of Mediocrity. To hell with the old, washed up Riders of the Apocalypse. War, Pestilence, ya-de-da de da. They are all nasty, sure. But nasty in a permanent kind of way. You meet Death only once (unless you're Rincewind, then you run into him all the time). Mediocrity is much more insidious. You meet mediocrity everyday, and whenever you give in, that much more of your soul is lost. Give it all away to the "good enough man" and you have nothing left.<dd>Well, we're all in college now, and I know I've met more than one person passing the sands of their life away in this manner. Why are you here? <dd>...to get a good job, to get a nice house, to buy a nice dog, nice children, husband, wife, friends, ...life.<br> <dd>And you think this will do it? Do you even know why? Is this your parents dream? I mean, yeah sure, these words look pleasant and have a nice feel to them, but what the hell does it mean?<br><dd>It's not just the good life people. It's that guy who came here out of parent or peer pressure. It's that kid with a tint of hangover to his colour who still smells of piss water and smoke. It's that young girl dreaming after fame and drama. Even the high priced suit after the thrill of economic monetary battles. And it's the "I don't know" guy, there was nothing better to do. <dd>Power, prestige, money, love, they are all vague sort of limbo words, where you can't look to closely at the edges or you might realize that they were shaded in around the corners and there is really very little there after all. Granted they look good on a resume, but your life can't fit through a machine to be underlined and bold faced, no matter how advanced the technology.<br><dd>So think about it next time you are doing something for someone else, but do a half-assed job, remember to say "hi" to that sloppy dressed character slouching slightly as he meanders off the scene, snickering (though not with any sort of real humor. That would take way too much energy).<br></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i6p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i6p3.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../5/i5p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../7/i7p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
