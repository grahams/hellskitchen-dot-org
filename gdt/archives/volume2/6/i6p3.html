He had known all along, of course, that his job was useless to the operation as a whole, but you don't get promoted for leaving your post, even if you save the sorry asses of everybody else on the force while you're gone. The Lieutenant watched patiently, scratching and shifting every few minutes to keep the blood flowing.<br><dd>Then the impossible happened, someone actually left by the front gate, which meant the Lieutenant's hours of boredom were finally over. He radioed to say he was leaving his post to track the suspects, heard the go-ahead reply, and started the car.<p><dd>"But you promised me that I would get the bracelet when all this was over! You promised!" His slap echoed in the surrounding forest, and she stepped back, awed.<br><dd>"Shut up," he hissed, "you want the whole friggin' neighborhood to think we've got the bracelet we've been swearing ignorance of for three days!?"<dd>"Sorry, Vic, I just got excited, I ain't used to this, ya know? This ain't the normal daily routine or somethin," she pouted as she got in the front seat of the little sports car, "You don't hafta hit me like that."<br><dd>"Aw, I'm sorry baby," he said over the noise as he revved the engine, "I know I shouldn't scare you, but you gotta be careful or we're in big trouble, and I ain't in no mood for big trouble, ok?" She nodded with a slight hidden smile, and they turned left onto the dirt road. "Nobody else ever uses this road," Vic said thoughtfully, "so who the hell followed us out here? Sandy, you recognize this car behind us?"<br><dd>"Shit, Vic, i can't even see it right, but it sorta looks boxy and flat, like maybe it could be Virginia or somebody? I don't know."<br><dd>"Virginia!?" Vic gawked, "Nah, it can't be her, she oughta be halfway home by now. It's gotta either be the cops, or some random asshole who doesn't know he's trespassing. either way, I'm gonna lose him in the bends up ahead - nobody knows this road better than I do."<br><dd>"Yeehah! Here we go - hang on, baby!" Vic hit the gas as he entered the series of switchbacks that led through the pass. The car behind sped up, too. They were definitely being followed, but they were starting to gain ground. On the last turn, they heard the screech of breaks and sliding tires on the dirt road behind them. Sandy turned to look through the rear window, and caught a glint of metal flying over the edge.<br><dd>"They're gone, Vic, slow down now, ok? I saw 'em go over the edge."<p><font size=-1><I>To be Continued...</I></font size><P></TD></tr></table><TABLE  width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=center><P><B><font size=+3>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre would like to help<br> celebrate Samhain with a week of issues, but <br> we need your help.</font size></B></tr></td></TABLE><TABLE width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=left valign=top><P><B><font size=+2>Submit stories, pictures, poems, and other creativeendeavors that deal with some aspect of Halloween.<br> The best will be printed in special issues.<br>For more information, contact<br><A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</a></font size></B></td><td><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol2/pumpkin2.gif"></td></tr></td></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i6p2.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i6p4.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../5/i5p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../7/i7p1.html">Next Issue</A>  <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
