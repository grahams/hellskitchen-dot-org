I'm not sure why I'd like to do this but I think it has something do with that "Chicken and Egg" question.  <p>As for the lava vs the parana thing. I think I am going to have to go with spending an evening with Rush Limbaugh. Being dropped into a pit of lava or eaten by piranhae just sounds like too horrible of a death.  Err, uhm wait, no I think I will go with the piranhae, or lava, or both. Then served as an entree, "chared fish and Marc."  Baked beyond perfection.

We have a hard time finding copies, and often fist fights break out over them, and old issues can be traded for cigerettes and nude photo's of peoples sisters.Haveing copies here would make life much easier.<p><dd>Welp, toodles.<p><dd>BTW, have you ever owned sea monkeys? i found out 2 weeks ago toys r us sells them and i have a nice crop of them growing in a keen littleaquarium on top of my computer. They are incredibly distracting, your eyes sort of see them and you just HAVE to watch them swim around and do little brine-shrimpish things. it took me 15 mins to write this letter cause i kept looking at those damn sea monkeys. You kinda feel like a god, though. your own self contained universe you control. helps the ego.<p>ah, well.<p>ta!<br>-Ed<br></tr></table><TABLE  width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=right><P><ADDRESS><font size=-1>Responses and submissions can be sent to:<A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> </font size=-1></ADDRESS></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><ADDRESS><font size=-1>or 472 French Rd Rochester, NY 14618</ADDRESS></font size></TD></TR><tr><td align=right><font size=-2>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre reserves the right to reprint <br>any correspondance recieved, without prior editing.</font size></tr></td></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i6p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br><A HREF="../5/i5p1.html">Previous Issue</a> - <A HREF="../../volume1/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume3/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../7/i7p1.html">Next Issue</A>  <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 2</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
