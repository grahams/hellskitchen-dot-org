St. Jude was a blood relative of Christ and one of the 12 apostles. St. Jude (referred to as Judas in the gospels of Mark and Luke) is the Saint invoked in times of hopeless, desperate or impossible circumstances. It is due to the fact that his name is identical to that of Christ's betrayer( but what a kisser!) that he received little veneration in the past. His martyrdom occurred when he and St. Simon traveled to Persia to preach-they were beaten to death with clubs.  <P></TD><td valign=bottom align=right><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol2/v2i7p3.1.gif"><br><B>St. Jude Oct. 28</B></td></tr></table>Below are some of the martyrs we missed from earlier in the month.<table width=600><tr><td valign=top><B>Oct.9</B><br><dd>St.Denis was sent from Rome to minister to the pagan Gauls in the year 90.
