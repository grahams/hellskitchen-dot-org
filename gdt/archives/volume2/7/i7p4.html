But you, you were the closest I ever came to it. That boy may have defiled my body, but you surely defiled my mind.<br><dd>As I sat across your desk from you and you assumed the mask of my friend and confidant, you really thought you played the part well didn't you? And I rewind the moment back to a night. That night when that boy ground and smothered me in an empty place with the fullest audience of the sky sparkling down their approval.<br><dd>That night when I said no, but my body said yes. The yes was enunciated while that boy would not listen to me inside and I left a hollow outside behind, hollow, mistreated, ignored shell behind. I journeyed to the sky so full of companions as if almost to completely ignore all physical sensations and returned once that boy could do no more.<br><dd>Later on that boy was to say that he was not accountable for his actions, but that I was. I was accountable because of all of the littlest things I do that I never even thought about. Things I do all the time, except now they had been done for his benefit only. I suppose even when he was not around. For a year afterward I watched everything I did, I stopped myself from ever becoming comfortable so that no one else would have the right to do this to me, a right they had never possessed in the first place.<br><dd>Once again I returned to the room with a man, my advocate, my friend? No, I don't think so.<br><dd>"Why didn't you scream?"<br><dd>"There was no one there. There was no one to hear me."<br><dd>"That doesn't matter. Screaming is a disabler whether anyone else is around to do anything or not."<br><dd>I'm sorry I must have forgotten all of my lessons from grade school on how best to get sexually assaulted....<br><dd>"Being raped is a disabler as well."<br><dd>If a girl screams when she's being raped in an empty place with a rapist who has not listened to her up to this point, does she make a sound?<br></TD></tr></table><p><table    width=550><tr><td valign=top><table   width=200><tr><td><center><B><font size=+1><A NAME="survey"></A>Survey</font size></B></center><br>"Would you rather accidentally kill a dolphin or purposely kill a Nun?"<p>"Would you rather get flattened by a steam roller or inflated with a garden hose?</td></tr><tr><td align=right><font size=-1>Send replies to GDT c/o:<br><A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</a></font size></td></tr></table><p><table border width=210><tr><td><table  width=210><tr><td valign=top><center><B><font size=+1>Devoted Readers of GDT:</font size></B></center><p><dd>Issue 6 of Volume 2 is still MIA.
