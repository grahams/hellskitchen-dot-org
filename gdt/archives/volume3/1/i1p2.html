For the next few weeks we will be printing up several common colloquialisms which have been reconstructed in a more verbose manner. The winner of the contest will be the person capable of deciphering more of these colloquialisms than anyone else. The prize will be fifty dollars (cash, none of this "the card" crap), and if the winner chooses, they may also become privy to the secrets of "Cafe Diablo" the most diabolical coffee in the world and the official drink of Hell Inc. The winner's name will be posted in the first issue of volume 4. All answers must be sent to GDT by Reading Day (February 21st, 1996) at the end of the quarter. GDT bids you good luck.<br><dd>Just to illustrate what we're looking for, we're going to give you the first one free:<p><font size=+1>This Week's Colloquialisms:</font size><br><UL><LI>          1.

Did you ever wonder why things in sizes you used to have to go to a specialty store to find have become so popular? One thing that probably contributes to it is that many young people today are too out of shape or at least a lot more buoyant than they used to be (that is except for witches who were always burnt to a crisp afterward so they don't really count), and they would prefer that others really couldn't decipher what size or shape they are. They prefer such reasonably stationary sports as "hacking" for an afternoon outside. They also spend hours upon their collective (or collected as the case maybe) asses watching cable TV, videos, playing Nintendo, or surfing the internet all the while eating those high fat, high sugar, high calorie, low nutrition snack foods that are so popular in this country.<br> <dd>The popularity of marijuana use doesn't help either, what with the munchies people experience while high and the lasting effect on the lungs which prevents extended physical exertion. America has become a land of the fat, home of the lame. No wonder people find themselves playing games of hide and seek in among yards of excess fabric.</td></tr></table><p><table width=550><tr><td valign=top><A NAME="random"></A><font size=+2><B>Random Acts of E-mail</B></font size><table width=200><tr><td align=right><font size=-1>-from Mark Nowak</font size></td></tr></table><p>     <dd>I'm suffering a drought.

You know, like on every third episode of Star Trek:  The Bald Captain (The other two episodes being "The Crew goes Back in Time" and "An Alien Entity Invades the Enterprise").  Actually, the first captain is pretty bald by now too, but at least he has the insecurity to cover it up.<br><dd>Do I babble?<br><table width=200><tr><td align=right>				-Engage!</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=right><P><ADDRESS><font size=-1>Responses and submissions can be sent to:<A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> </font size=-1></ADDRESS></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><ADDRESS><font size=-1>or 472 French Rd, Rochester, NY  14618</ADDRESS></font size></TD></TR><tr><td align=right><font size=-2>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre reserves the right to reprint <br>any correspondance recieved, without prior editing.</font size></tr></td></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i1p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i1p3.html">Next Page</A><br>Previous Issue - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../2/i2p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
