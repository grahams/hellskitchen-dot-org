Our martyr of the week for December 10-16 is the popular St. Lucy of Syracuse (Sicily, not upstate NY.) After her mother was cured at the shrine of St. Agnes, Lucy vowed to remain a virgin until death. Her acts of charity were distressing to her gold-digging fiance and he reported her as a Christian to the Roman authorities. Since it was illegal to execute virgins under Roman law, Lucy was sentenced to be deflowered in a brothel prior to death. This was to no avail, a team of oxen could not move our Saint from where she chastely stood. She survived being burned at the stake, but finally succumbed to a sword in the throat. At some point during these ordeals she plucked out her eyes as a gift for her estranged suitor, and thus she is depicted in art as holding her eyes on a plate.</td><td valign=top><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol3/v3i1p4.1.gif"><br>St. Lucy - December 13th</td>  </tr></table><p><table width=550><tr><td width=250 valign=top><A NAME="holiday"></A><font size=+2><B>Happy Holidays</B></font size><br><font size=-1>Original Author: Joseph Brendler, CPT, SC, Instructor, D/PhysicsDistributed by: Yetta Howard (smasher@acs.bu.edu) Subject: SantaQuestion: Is there a Santa Claus?</font size><p><dd>No known living species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 30,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has seen.<br><dd>There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million, according to the Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there is at least one good child in each.<br><dd>Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stocking, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding, etc.<br></td><td><br></td><td valign=top width=250><dd>This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, about 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on each, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run maybe 15 miles per hour tops.<dd>The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized Lego&trade; set (2 pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,000 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine reindeer. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison, this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the cruise ship, that is).<br><dd>353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft reentering the earth's atmosphere. The leading pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. PER SECOND. EACH. In short, they will into flame almost instantly, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subject to centrifugal forces 17,500.6 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of forces.<br><dd>In conclusion - if Santa ever did deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.<br></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i1p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br>Previous Issue - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../2/i2p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
