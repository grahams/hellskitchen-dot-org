I couldn't find the ending anywhere in the issue. Also, i found your issues in the trash can in the TV lounge... looks like one of the Christians next door to me got to them first... funny thing is, he didn't bother to put them in the recycling bin, probably didn't want to contaminate the 'holy goodness' of the entire recycling program... pfft.<br> <dd>The one inane thing about them is they always post scriptures on their door every week, and i see it every time i walk by to get to my room... so, any  suggestions as to what I can do about that?<table width=200><tr><td align=right>-Cyrano</td></tr></table>  </td><td><br></td> <td valign=top width=50%><font size=+2><B>Ask BFG</B></font size><br><dd>First of all, if you hadn't noticed already, we get a little sloppy at times. We misplaced the end of last week's issue, so we're reprinting it in this issue (Since this is on the web, just read the <A HREF="../1/i1p1.html">previous issue's first page</A> for a complete issue).<br><dd>As for those pesky Christian problems, I've got a plan. In your quest to divert those ever so environmentally conscious Christians from trashing our future...issues, I suggest you help us start a religious jihad.<br><dd>If your knowledge of Christian organizations on campus is not as up to date as our own, it might be interesting to note that there are two virulent groups on campus; Brothers And Sisters In Christ, and the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. I'd like to see if we can test the extent of their brotherly love to find out just how far a Christian Soldier is willing to go (stay tuned for more details).<br><table width=200><tr><td align=right > -BFG</td></tr></table></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i2p3.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - Next Page<br><A HREF="../1/i1p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../3/i3p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
