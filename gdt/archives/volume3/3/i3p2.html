For the next few weeks we will be printing up several common colloquialisms which have been reconstructed in a more verbose manner. The winner of the contest will be the person capable of deciphering more of these colloquialisms than anyone else. The prize will be fifty dollars (cash, none of this "the card" crap), and if the winner chooses, they may also become privy to the secrets of "Cafe Diablo" the most diabolical coffee in the world and the official drink of Hell Inc. The winner's name will be posted in the first issue of volume 4. All answers must be sent to GDT by Reading Day (February 21st, 1996) at the end of the quarter.

One wonderful tradition is the use of a diamond as an engagement ring. How many centuries ago did this tradition start? Why a diamond? Does it have a special significance in the area of the world where the tradition originated? The answer to the last question is: you bet it does.     <dd>  In South Africa, where most of the diamonds in the world are mined, there is but one company doing the mining: DeBeers. This same company decides who they distribute their diamonds to for cutting.   <dd>   Yeah, they've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow....because the idea of using a diamond as an engagement ring, thought up by our friends at DeBeers in the early part of this century as a way of selling more diamonds, is now a hallowed wedding tradition. What's three months' salary for something that will last forever? A lot, considering diamonds aren't as rare as emeralds or sapphires, but cost more because the good people at DeBeers can charge whatever they want for their product in the absence of competition. So just remember this little fact when the 25th Anniversary Diamond Bracelet is a hallowed anniversary tradition.    <dd>   "Tell her you'd get suckered by a slick marketing ploy...all over again."</td></tr></table><p><TABLE width=550 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><TR><TD align=right><P><ADDRESS><font size=-1>Responses and submissions can be sent to:<A HREF="mailto:diablo@csh.rit.edu">diablo@csh.rit.edu</A> </font size=-1></ADDRESS></TD></TR><TR><TD align=right><ADDRESS><font size=-1>or 472 French Rd, Rochester, NY  14618</ADDRESS></font size></TD></TR><tr><td align=right><font size=-2>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre reserves the right to reprint <br>any correspondance recieved, without prior editing.</font size></tr></td></TABLE><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i3p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i3p3.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../2/i2p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../4/i4p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
