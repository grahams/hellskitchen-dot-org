Ulfrid was an English missionary to the Scandinavians in the 11th century. In one of his attempts to persuade the locals that they were being idolatrous, he took an axe to a  statue of the god Thor. The Swedes did not take kindly to such an attack on their beloved thunder God, so they lynched him.<br></td><td width=250 valign=top><table border><tr><td><font size=+2><center>DOES GOD EXIST?</font size><p><font size=+1>IF SO, WHERE IS HE?</font size><p><i>Bring your comments and/or questions to an open campus discussion led by a guest speaker.&#167<p>We'd like to hear YOUR opinion!

You survey the incredible scenery around you and think..."I wonder how my friend Joe is doing?"<br>   <dd>   No...we don't think so.<br>   <dd>   In fact, we seriously doubt the majority of rock climbers are upset about the limited availability of pay phones in the Rocky Mountains. Sometimes the whole point of such endeavors is to work as a close team with  another person (who is actually there), or to be alone. Is that comprehensible to you?<br>  <dd>   Do you know why people go to the beach? Ahhh, we're not sure, but we don't think it's to do office work. Is making pie charts or writing memos supposed to be more enjoyable from the beach? Wouldn't it just make the beach less enjoyable?<br>  <dd>   "Have you ever been in inescapable reach of your work or other people you don't want to talk to? You will." But who wants to?<br>    <dd>  Some mid-level manager or office paper pusher is not that excited about their job to be in contact with it 24 hours a day. Besides, what is the big need? "Bob, the copier isn't collating! We need you right away!" Who came up with the idea that people should sacrifice lives to jobs anyway? If there is any way to avoid your vision of the future without sicking the Unabomber on your connective ass, please let us know.<br>   <dd>  But don't expect to get in touch with us via beepers, faxes, wrist telephones or ATM machines.  We're ignoring you as hard as we can.<br>	<table valign=top><tr><td width=250 align=right>								Sincerely,<br></td><td width=250 align=left><br>									   Ah Meester Bom-bas-teak<br></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  border width=550 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0><tr><td width=250  valign=top><dd>Rumor has it that a young woman was raped at a recent frat party and that the local police have been notified.
