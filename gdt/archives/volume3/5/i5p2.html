For the next few weeks we will be printing up several common colloquialisms which have been reconstructed in a more verbose manner. The winner of the contest will be the person capable of deciphering more of these colloquialisms than anyone else. The prize will be fifty dollars (cash, none of this "the card" crap), and if the winner chooses, they may also become privy to the secrets of "Cafe diablo/gdt" the most diabolical coffee in the world and the official drink of Hell Inc. The winner's name will be posted in the first issue of volume 4. All answers must be sent to GDT by Reading Day (February 21st, 1996) at the end of the quarter. GDT bids you good luck.<p><font size=+1>This Week's Colloquialisms:</font size><br><UL><LI>	13.  Sorting on the part of mendicants must be interdicted.<LI>	14.
