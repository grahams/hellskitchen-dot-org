She lives in a small retirement home, so she's limited on space. She is very frail health wise, so traveling is out. She really has everything she could ever need, and from my perspective, everything she could ever want. We feel she would be hurt if we didn't get her anything. Do you have any suggestions?<p>			<dd>	Signed,<br>		<dd>		   Need an Idea<p><I>Dear Need an Idea,<p>  <dd>   I think it's wonderful that you care about your grandmother enough to be concerned about a gift. Often, people in your grandmother's situation, (people who have everything) really only wnat one thing, the love and admiration of their family members. You may want to arrange a time to speak with this grandmother and express to her your inner feelings. In fact, if you could get both your "inner children" to connect, the experience would be mutually rewarding.<p>   <dd>  If you really insist on getting her something that she doesn't already have, something she would definitely use, and something that would fit within the great grandchildrens' budget, you may want to consider a funeral home registry. Family members could register to purchase various parts of her eventual funeral ie: one person could register flowers, another for the minister, and another for the musicians, (I hear the Eagles are looking for a gig). Several people could go in together for some of the more expensive items such as the coffin and coffin upgrades (extra cushioning, satin sheets etc.) or a shiny new set of burial dentures etc. The gifts could continue to grow with each birthday and gift giving occasion. If she lives to be a hundred, she could really go out inn style!</I><p><font size=-1>Copyright 1995 by Dr. Cy Kosis</font size><p></td></tr></table><table border width=200 align=right valign=top><tr><td>Need advice?
