This is a first in a number of ways; it is our first eight page publication, as well as our first visit to the University of Rochester.<br>  <dd>   That's right. As far as we know, this publication has become the first intentional inter-collegic reader supported publication run by students. Give yourselves a hand...your hate mail has made all this possible (thanks Reporter).<br></td></tr></table><table width=400><tr><td><table width=200 valign=top><tr><td><B>A Special Note for readers at the Rochester Institute of Technology:</B><p><dd>In January of last year, the founding Triumvirate of Gracies Dinnertime Theatre tried to bring a little spice to the Reporter, but were rejected (as a side note, is your "Opinion" section an attempt to achieve a tamer version of GDT?)..<br>  <dd>   At first, we were bitter, which prompted us to begin printing in earnest. Looking back on all that has happened in a year, I'd like to take this time to thank the Reporter; if you had not rejected us, we would be under your control. None of this would be possible. No web site, no Dr. Cy. Kosis, no Melancholy Predator.<br>  <dd>   Now we are getting bigger, and need the support of RIT fans more than ever. We're entering unknown, possibly dangerous territory by expanding to the University of Rochester.<br> <dd>     In the past, getting feedback from the stereotypically apathetic students at RIT has been like pulling teeth. Well, here's your chance to show readers at other institutions that those at RIT can do more than use a slide rule.<br>		<dd>-GDT editors<p></td></tr></table></td><td><table width=200 valign=top><tr><td><B>A Special Note for readers at the University of Rochester:</B><p> <dd> In the past, the students at the U of R have had the Norm, though only three times a year. We found this amazingly prudish. To supply your weekly humor, satire, and creative needs, we offer ourselves like the literary whores we are.<br> <dd>    In a year of publishing, Gracies Dinnertime Theatre (GDT for short) missed its deadline only once. We appeared the next day and GDT stood for "Got Delayed Today." For as long as we appear on the University of Rochester, we guarantee weekly issues (at least that is the policy of the current staff).<br>   <dd>  Between you and us, the students of RIT are an apathetic bunch; we rarely receive submissions. With your experience with the Norm, you should be able to dazzle us.<br>  <dd>   Send us you submissions and show those techy-nerds what real humor and creativity is.<br>	<dd>	-GDT editors<p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=400 valign=top align=right><tr><td><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol3/v3i7p2.1.gif"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i7p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i7p3.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../6/i6p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../8/i8p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
