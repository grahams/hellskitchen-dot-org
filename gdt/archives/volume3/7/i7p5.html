Help!<p>		<dd>		Signed,<br>		<dd>		  Catastrophe<p><I>Dear Catastrophe,<p>  <dd>   Obviously, you're frustrated with this situation. You can't live with the cat, and at the same time you're worried that if the cat goes, your wife will resent you for having caused her loss. Even though it's your allergies creating the choice between you or the cat, you're correct in assuming the loss of the cat could potentially cause subconscious resentful feelings within your spouse. In today's worlds, chances of your marriage succeeding with a cat lover are slim enough without this added challenge. Open lines of communication are the best way of avoiding a potential catastrophe in your relationship.</I><br></td></tr></table></td><td><TABLE width=240  valign=top><tr><td>   <dd> <I>While communication is important, it would be easier to communicate if she could first understand the actual physical discomfort that you feel. To accomplish this, quite frankly, nothing works like cat hair. Start today, without your cat knowing, to put one cat hair in her food. Tomorrow, put two, the next day four, and eight, etc., until she complains, then cut the number back by half but keep putting them in without her knowledge. You may even put a few in your own food just so she doesn't suspect you as the culprit. Go to the pet store and buy a frozen mouse (yes, they do sell them), defrost it and leave half lying around somewhere conspicuous. Go to the cat box and extract several moist chunks of "kitty surprise" and place them in the middle of your wife's favorite bed spread. And finally, pick out your wife's favorite piece of furniture and take a wire brush to the corner of it. Suddenly, your wife will begin to look at the cat differently while you, instead of the cat, are snuggled up next to her on the couch.</I><p></td></tr></table><TABLE  border width=200  valign=top align=right><tr><td>Need advice?

Is there anything you'd like to tell us?<br>			<dd>		-A Concerned Member of the Staff<p>Dear Concerned Staff Member,<br>  <dd>   In biology being female is commonly referred to as the "default" setting on humans. If in doubt, it will probably turn out to be female, this will also sometimes occur even when an individual possesses XY chromosomes. In fact, many of the female athletes who preform in the Olympics actually have XY chromosomes. They are merely men who probably did not receive a dose of hormones at the right time and thus did not develop the usual male organs.<br>  <dd>   You may be asking yourself at this point, what does this have to do with the superfluous organ I flaunted in last week's quote?<br> <dd>   The answer is, not a whole hell of a lot. From what research I've done, it seems to be just a parallel temporal anomaly stemming from the fact that I was a tomboy at age 11. My doctor assures me that the disfigurement will disappear within a few weeks and that if I just pluck the chest hair for a while it too will eventually clear up.<br>   <dd>  Thanks for your concern,<br>		<dd>				-Bare Foot Girl<p><font size=+1>Do you have a question for the Bare Foot Girl?
