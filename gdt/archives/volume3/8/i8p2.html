He's written more than forty two books, three dozen motion pictures and television scripts,and more than 1100 essays, reviews, articles, short stories, and newspaper columns. He still sends all of his acceptance slips to the teacher he had in college who told him he'd never publish anything. To the GDT head editors, he is a minor authoral deity, right up there with Terry Pratchett, Richard Bach, and Ayn Rand, way up there). When we contacted him, he seemed interested in coming to speak saying that he hadn't been in Rochester for some time. He even offered to reduce his normal speaker's fee as well as spend the day before his lecture speaking in various literary and film classes around campus.<br>   <dd>  Our staff editors drew up a proposal and submitted it to the College Activities Board, who after a month of postponement, finally rejected the proposal. They did however, invite Bill Maher, host of "Politically Incorrect" and star of the B-movie "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."<br>   <dd>  It seems ironic that the "Politically Incorrect" staff found Harlan Ellison to be interesting and current enough to have on their show, but CAB preferred Bill Maher.<br>  <dd>   If you are interested in seeing Harlan Ellison speak at RIT, help us encourage CAB to see the light. If you have no opinion, read one of his books and then see how you feel.<br></td><td width=175><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol3/v3i8p2.2.gif"><br><font size=-1>Harlan Ellison writing a new story in a bookstore window</font size><p>A by no means inclusive list of works by Harlan Ellison<p><B><U>NOVELS</U></B><br><I>Web of the City</I> (1958)<br>   <I>The Sound of a Scythe</I> (1960)<br> <I>Spider Kiss</I> (1961)<p><B><U>GRAPHIC NOVELS</U></B><br><I>Demon With a Glass Hand</I> (GraphicAdaptation with Marshall Rogers) (1986)<br>                                 <I>Night and the Enemy</I> (Graphic Adaptation with Ken Steacy) (1987)<br><I>Vic and Blood: The Chronicles of a Boy and his Dog </I>(Graphic Adaptation with Richard Corben) (1989)<p><B><U>SHORT STORY COLLECTIONS</U></B><br><I>The Deadly Streets</I> (1958)<br><I>Sex Gang</I> (as Paul Merchant) (1959)<br><I>A Touch of Infinity</I> (1960)<br><I>Children of the Streets</I> (1961)<br>          <I>Gentleman Junkie and other stories of the hung-up generation</I> (1961)<br>       <I>Ellison Wonderland</I> (1962)<br><I>Paingod  and other delusions</I> (1965)<br>          <I>I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream</I> (1967)<br>     <I>From the Land of Fear</I> (1967)<br><I>Love Ain't Nothing but Sex Misspelled</I> (1968)<br>    <I>The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World </I>(1969)<br>     <I>Over the Edge</I> (1970)<br><I>De Helden Van De Highway</I> (Dutch publication only) (1973)<br>        <I>All the Sounds of Fear </I>(British publication only) (1973)<br>    <I>The Time of the Eye</I> (British publication only) (1974)<br><I>Approaching Oblivion</I> (1974)<br>         <I>Deathbird Stories</I> (1975)<br>          <I>No Doors, No Windows </I>(1975)<br><I>Hoe Kan Ik Schreeuwen Zonder Mond</I> (Dutch publication only) (1977)<br></td></tr></table><P><P><hr><P><font size=-1><center><A HREF="i8p1.html">Previous Page</a> - <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> - <A HREF="i8p3.html">Next Page</A><br><A HREF="../7/i7p1.html">Previous Issue</A> - <A HREF="../../volume2/welcome.html">Previous Volume</A> - <A HREF="../../volume4/welcome.html">Next Volume</A> - <A HREF="../9/i9p1.html">Next Issue</A> <br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="../welcome.html">Volume 3</A><br> </nobr></font size></center></html>
