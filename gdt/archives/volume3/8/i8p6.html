We have no sacred cows either, although Melancholy Predator has a molting mascot, but that is way beyond the point. There is nothing we won't print and you know it.<br>  <dd>   This isn't entirely true, because GDT was started after our staff members became disenchanted with the normal realm that humor resides, and we wanted to make a nice cosy place where our disturbed mental psyches could happily cavort without fear of top ten lists, dumb blonde jokes, or any of the other hideously common things you might find while browsing through, "Truly Tasteless Jokes" (whatever volume you have, they're all the same) or receiving mass e-mailings.<br>   <dd>  So if you, like us, just can't seem to find that last shred of human decency you used to keep in your sock drawer, then join us. We don't care if you're from the U of R, RIT, or even half way around the world, we want you.<br><table><tr><td width=150 valign=top><IMG SRC="../../../images/vol3/v3i8p6.1.gif"><br></td><td width=140> And if you could manage it, we would really like to have a flaming homosexual become one of our writers as well.
