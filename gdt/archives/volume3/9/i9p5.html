I have heard of strange things falling from the sky in my time.  Fish, frogs, colored hailstorms, and once long ago in my hometown I myself had witnessed countless thousands of strands of angel hair like glossimar strands come filtering down from a clear blue sky.  However I have never, ever heard of dismembered body parts hailing down from above.<br>     <dd>   As soon as it stopped I stepped off my porch into my yard.  The first ting I noticed was the strangeness of the rainwater.  Instead of collecting in pools and leaving droplets about the grass and trees, the odd scented water instead rolled off of all objects as if it was quicksilver and was immediately absorbed into the ground.  Within several minutes my house and backyard was completely dry, as if there had never been a rainstorm.  Except for the heads, of course.<br>       <dd>  The first head that I approached had been one of the unlucky ones, its skull having been split open as it hit a somewhat hard patch of ground.  It was face down in the (now dry) dirt and I peered cautiously into the largish hole in the back of the skull, expecting the worst.   Brains or blood, or whatever one usually expects to see within a human skull.<br>     <dd>    I saw neither.<br>      <dd>   Instead the inside was a smooth and featureless, like the inside of a hollow melon.  The color was a ruddy reddish orange and looked all the world more vegetable than animal.  I stepped away, perplexed, and strolled over to the next nearest head.  This one was fully intact and had landed upright.  It was a male face with sandy brown hair, and as I circled it to meet it face to face I was surprised once again by seeing its eyes were open.  And it was staring at me.<br>       <dd>  Well, not for long.  As soon as it had noticed me staring back its eyes flicked forward as if it had been guiltily caught doing something it was not supposed to be doing.  This sent numerous amounts of the willies crawling up and down the back of my spine.  But steeling myself, I cleared my throat and murmured "Um, excuse me?"<br>      <dd>  The head ignored me.  I repeated my greeting and was once again met with stony indifference.  I then proceeded to do the next logical thing, I nudged it with my toe.<br>   <dd>   The eyes flashed upwards to glare at me with infinite annoyance, and it hissed at me, quite clearly, the words 'Go Away' and then returned its gaze to its previous position.  As horrified and repulsed as I was, I could not but help feel a bit miffed at this bodiless intruder on my property, barking orders at me like some superior entity.<br>      <dd>  I was about to open my mouth and speak a proper rebuttal, when high above me a section of the odd colored cloud cover thinned out and a shaft of pure sunlight pierced down from the heavens and made a neat summer glow on my lawn.  The response of instantaneous.  Those heads that were still more or less intact swiveled around to gawk at this shaft of clean, bright light.   Suddenly I became aware of an intense high pitch warbling sound that increased in intensity and pitch, and it took me a moment to realize that it was emanating from the heads about me.  This unearthly chorus was completely unfathomable to me, weather they were crying in joy or shrieking in fear I could not judge.<br>        <dd>   The clouds above me quickly began to disperse and the shaft of sunlight grew wider and wider.  When the sunlight came into contact with the first head, It began to swell quickly and grotesquely, eyes bulging and tongue protruding, and finally exploded in a resounding pop.</td><p><td width=250>  The pieces that were scattered across my lawn melted into a queer bluish substance and was drained into the ground as quickly as the rain had.  Within seconds the air was filled with the sounds of popping heads and the same scent that the rain had produced became more profound.<br>     <dd>   This lasted perhaps a minute and soon the odd clouds overhead were completely gone, and not a trace of the strange head-filled rainfall remained in my backyard.  I stood there dumbly, drained of my very reasoning of reality, basking in the soft glow of the summer sunlight.<br>       <dd> I really don't think about what happened very often.  I realize that the universe we live in is greater and more unfathomable than anyone could begin to comprehend.  Perhaps my backyard simply passed through one of those spots of space and time where reason simply does not work as it does elsewhere.<br>     <dd>   But then again, perhaps the Earth itself if one of those spots.
