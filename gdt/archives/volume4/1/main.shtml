(Sure, we all do.) I'm not talking about the cheap Christian imitations, but the real Romans. Back when Pagans were Pagans and Christians were a wacky sub-sect of Judaism waiting for Jesus to come back with the metaphorical pizza (if your Messiah is late, you get the second one free). Think of all the things the Romans built and the vast empire they controlled. What administrators; sheesh, talk about planning. From roads, to food storage, to aqueducts, to breeding programs.<br>  <dd>  That's right. The Romans are the first to fully use eugenics in a Herbertian fashion. Years of breeding the right couples to achieve their penultimate Emperor. But something went wrong...horribly wrong. He was born a generation too soon, and mad as a hatter.<br>      <dd>Yeah, the last great Roman emperor was Caligula. What a crazy, twisted mother fucker (quite literally) he was. Inbreeding, incest, and lead lined cups and pipes came together to make his insanity even more endearing. After Caligula all the other emperors just paled in comparison (as did many of Caligula's subjects. Ohhh, yes...). The Romans went from the most powerful empire in the Mediterranean to being a bunch of hicks roaming through Europe and the like. One minute they were HUGE and the next they're just a bunch of second rate psychotics with delusions of the grandeur they had once possessed. The Romans built the Pantheon, one of the most spectacular examples of architectural engineering in the world, an act those pseudo-Romans (ie. Christians) and Europeans during the same time period couldn't even come close to for another six hundred years, and only then because they stole the knowledge from the Moors in Spain. Those bloody fools couldn't even get their churches to stand up; some churches had to be rebuilt five or six times until the foundations could actually support the structures ("The other kings thought I was daft to build a castle on a swamp..."). The Romanesque churches<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a>  were truly the wooden clogs of architecture, they'd keep you dry, give you a place to stick rotting dead saints, and if you were lucky they  wouldn't fall on you.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>   Why did the once great Romans become Christian simpletons? It's quite elementary: all that lead from the aforementioned lead pipes and cups not only made them twitch a lot, but paranoid as well. They became convinced that the world was out to get them, and the Christians wholeheartedly agreed. They said that God was punishing them for not being Christian, not to mention being born (a creed still spread today). Once it was not only safe to be Christian, but highly dangerous to be anything else (as soon as enough Christians rose to power, their old standby brotherly love got his ass kicked out the window), the masses were easily converted. If they weren't converted, they were either burned at the stake, had holy wars declared against them, or were eventually given yellow flowers and sent to gas chambers...depending, of course, upon what time period is being examined.<br>  <dd>   This same crazy/stupid paranoia is also a good explanation for the mass conversion of many of the indigenous populations of Latin and South America (the Spanish Inquisition with their oh-so-subtle Islam-like conversion methods didn't hurt either). The natives just exchanged lead poisoning with being high on cocaine. Those funny little buggers would walk across the Andies to market over tiny straw suspension bridges with the equivalent of a grand piano strapped to their heads, not giving a damn as long as they had that Coca leaf in their mouth with a little added lime to chew on.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    If you think of the situation they found themselves in at the time, most of the farmers were crazy, high, and paranoid, and the rest of the population was just dying (huzzah smallpox!). They were little bastards (I mean they hadn't had the Church to marry them yet) and easily converted after most of them were just about dead.<br> <dd>    After all, what else did they have to lose, but their culture?<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Many of these churches would have tall spindly steeples and miniscule naves. You could fit maybe seven people in them, but those who could squeeze into the tenuous structures could see God, or maybe that was just the pressure and the lack of oxygen getting to their heads (see auto erotic asphyxiation).<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
