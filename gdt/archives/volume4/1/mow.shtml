The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>March 17-23</B> is <B>St. Edward the Martyr</B> (<B>March 18</B>). Edward, the son of St Edgar the peaceful, assumed the British throne at the age of 13 upon his father's death. When our saint was 16 he was killed while visiting his half brother at Corfe. His stepmother (his father's second wife, Elfrida) instigated the assassination in order that her  son, Ethelred, could be King. When miracles began being reported in the ate of Edward's grave, Ethelred ordered a nationwide observance of his martyred brother's feast. The wicked (but penitent) stepmother joined a nunnery.<br>   <dd>  Other Saints of note this week include <B>St Joseph of Arimathaea</B> (<B>March 17</B> (He is famous for letting the disciples bury Christ in his tomb. Legend has it that after Christ's ascension St. Joseph traveled with St Mary Magdalene (who was not a prostitute) to France, and then went on alone to England and established a Church at Glastonbury. He supposedly brought the holy grail with him on this journey, which explains how this relic got to England.)) and of course <B>St Patrick</B> (also <B>March 17</B>). Patrick wasn't Irish; he was Welsh-Italian. His real name wasn't Patrick, it was Succat. He wasn't the first Christian missionary to Ireland (that was St. Palladius) and there were never any snakes in Ireland for him to drive out. Along with being the Patron of Ireland he is also the patron of Nigeria- so on this feast day raise a glass of Irish brew and belt out your favorite Nigerian drinking song! Here's to blood in your eye.<br>	<br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
