<html><TITLE>Subscription?</TITLE><P><body bgcolor=FFFFFF><A NAME="ad"><body><table cellpadding = 15 width = 400><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000></A><font color = white>  <dd>  Are you one of those poor unfortunates who is graduating this year and fear you will never enter your beloved Hell's Kitchen ever again? Well, fear not! Hell's Kitchen publications are offering subscriptions. That's right, Hell's Kitchen (or any derivation of its publications you choose) can be delivered to your door on a weekly basis.<br> <dd>    I know that earlier we had printed some sort of exorbitant number as the price of subscription, and to tell the truth, we screwed up the math. It won't be that expensive and it will be dependent on what parts of the publication you want delivered. The price of subscription will be determined on a quarterly basis, dependent upon length of publication and the price of stamps.<br>  <dd>   Just contact Hell's Kitchen and let them know which publications you are interested in receiving, and we'll send you a quarterly estimate of the price. <br></font color></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/ads.html">Other Ads in this Volume</A><br> <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> - <A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
