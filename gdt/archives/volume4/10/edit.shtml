This year has been a special one for us here at Hell's Kitchen. It saw the growth and expansion of GDT, the formation of the <I>Melancholy Predator</I> (much like Botticelli's "Venus"), and brief lifespan of <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>. Who would have thought last year that a column idea rejected by the <I>Reporter </I>would grow to be the nucleus of a group of publications read across the country and around the world? And ohhhh, do we have plans.<br>   <dd>  But it is the end of the year, and after over 30 issues (approximately 200 pages of fresh material. God, and to think we started with a single one sided page last year), we are all a little tired. Hopefully, after graduation and a summer of having to deal with people in the wide world, we'll be back with even more to share.<br>  <dd>   In the meantime, we'd like to thank all of our fans, both new and old. We'd also like to discuss something that was recently brought to our attention. When we used the Reporter's logo last week, that was what would be termed as "copyright infringement." Well, I suppose we could cower in the corner of our publication begging <font size=-2>the merciful </font size><I>Reporter's</I> pardon, but fuck that.<br>    <dd>  Two weeks ago when we lent them use of our <I>Euclidean Losers</I> (aka. the staff of <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>), first they changed our title, then they didn't even give credit to the authors (3 May, 1996 issue of the<I> Reporter</I>). Bad move guys. I guess we made one copyright infringement for each author that had been neglected, and, technically speaking, plagiarized. The only thing that stopped us from trying to nail the <I>Reporter</I> for plagiarism was we discovered that an apology was already being written for publication the next week (10 May, 1996 issue of the <I>Reporter</I>), even if it was in small-ass print.<br>  <dd>   Oh, had we forgotten to say we're sorry? Must have slipped our minds.<br>  <dd>    See you next year.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
