I could tell that you had a take on that when I saw you at your apartment 2 weekends ago, but BJ and I were not feeling well enough to stick around for your meeting. As you can see my letter to the Reporter in response to that opinion column was not printed. It was nice to see that a similar view was published (and in a much better publication).<br>                     <dd>           -Stephanie L.
