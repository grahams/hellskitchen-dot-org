In honor of our final issue of the year, political correctness, and giving everyone their fair share, we'd like to pick on the Jews for a while, but then again, who doesn't. And don't start snickering too loud Mohammed (and quit that twitching. Will someone stick a spoon in his mouth so he doesn't swallow his tongue?), you're next. As for the rest of you pale excuses for organized religions...we've got time.<p> <center><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images10/1.1.gif"><br></center> <dd>    I've one word for you: genocide. I admit, it's a scary thought. I'm not a Jew, though (I play one on TV...) my great grandmother was a certified Gypsy (tea-leaves, phony accent, the whole thing). Although this fact casts no light on a higher understanding of the Jewish plight, I just wanted it clear that some of my family (besides those who were accused of witchcraft) were used as charcoal briquettes. To try and obliterate a race based on arbitrary criteria is incredibly short-sited. Think of all the ideas that are lost when an entire people is obliterated (though this may be the intent. After all, wasn't the Cold War a dispute over two differing economic systems that could have easily erupted into global holocaust?). Think of those lost genes. No more big noses, no more crazy dredlocked sideburns, no more dead chickens hanging in store windows (yes, it's genetic), and sorry kids...no more draydls. We may just keep those kippas though; they're damn cheaper than Rogaine, not to mention more stylish than the Lewis Rukyser hinged-hair look ("We've secretly replaced this man's hair with a hand knit doily. Let's see if they notice the difference...").<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images10/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    The Jews did their share of raping and pilaging...besides since the founding of Israel I mean. Turn back the clocks, to the days when the Jews first stumbled upon their Holy Land. Imagine the beauty of the whole scenario: thousands of stinky Israelites, after decades of wandering around behind Moses finally realized that (...he had a front side too) test versions of Dr. Scholls just didn't cut it, and decided They&#153; had had enough. Of course Israelites called where They&#153; stopped the Promised Land (They&#153; didn't have Dairy Queens then, the real land of milk and honey, well milk and sucrose, so no one really knew what They&#153; were missing); after years in the desert, just stopping for a while is Paradise. Unfortunately, the Promised Land was currently inhabited with scads of people living their humdrum lives on plots of land that they had thought were quite ordinary...and quite theirs.<br> <dd>   So anyway, the sand sick Israelites wanted what They&#153; felt God had meant for them, which of course justified war. To make a long story short, the Israelites annihilated an entire people. The Amorites, while trying to defend their homes, were beaten back by the uncouth goat herders who had until recently been building shacks that would make Pythagoreus cry ("...at least if we had 21 people, then we could form an equilateral triangle..."). After the defeat of the Amorite army, the Israelites swept into their kingdom and proceeded to destroy the cities and kill the inhabitants. To quote the King James version of the Old Testament:<br>  <dd>   "Blah, blah, blah. Yadda yadda yadda."<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>    Good for them. Hooray! God's Chosen People finally killed themselves a homeland (a wounded homeland is a dangerous thing, you've got to kill it. If you don't believe me, just ask the Bosnians). Great. Just tell that to the people who were killed then, and later, as the Jews spread their dinky little kingdom like literacy in Arkansas (From #50 to #49 in the country in  a mere four years! Sorry Georgia. Let's elect that governor to the Presidency). In a way, it's ironic that the Semitic Promised Land became nothing more than a stop over for the great armies of the ancient world (Yup, just another sad rest area that ran out of toilet paper years ago). Hittites, Egyptians,  Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, they all marched through the Israelite's lands, pushing them around, making fun of their little hats, and generally acting snooty.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images10/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>    Koodos to the Romans for finally burning the Temple down and scattering the Jews around the globe. If it weren't for that single event, the Jews wouldn't have such a persecution complex. Seriously, what other group takes such pride in being picked on for thousands of years? Certainly not the blacks; they've only had a few hundred years practice. Besides, persecution has allowed the Jews to maintain their sense of identity. The Amish have their silly beards, the Brits have "The Big Book of British Smiles", ...the Jews have their persecution (sure, the Roman's were assholes to burn the Temple down in the first place, but as assholes go, the Roman's rocked. The Romans excelled at being assholes when subjugating people. And as far as holding a grudge for no particular reason, they were better than McCarthy. When the Roman's finally beat up Hannibal's friends, they went so far as to salt the ground of Carthage, making it a desert). Anyway, by scattering the Jews, that started a precedent for Jew bashing. Later, the Catholic Church did a really good job of generally being mean to the Jews. Even the Christians, who excelled in spilling blood in the name of the Prince of Peace, couldn't compare to the Nazi's.<br><dd>    Enter Hitler and his goose stepping blackshirts, doing the two step all over the throats of Europe. Forget that Hitler pulled Germany out of the worst depression the globe had ever seen. He's just remembered as a Megalo-maniac with a pear shaped body and a piece of felt just over his upper lip. Oh yeah, and the Holocaust.      The Final Solution wasn't all that smart (or all that final, or even really a solution at all. I guess it could be called Hitler's Temporary Stopgap<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a>). At least when the Romans burned the library at Alexandria, they used the books to heat bath water. All the Jews, Gypsies, Queers, Blacks, mentally ill, and anyone else they weren't particularly keen on just became a waste of gas, bullets, or air pollution.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a>Oh. almost forgot the lamp shades and handbags, but to be honest these Semite-skin bags never really did much for the state of worldly fashion at the time, and thus can be ignored.<br>   <dd>   It's kind of funny how a bunch of goat herders with delusions of grandeur escaped from Egypt, got sunburned, wiped out a race, and centuries later, Aryans with delusions of grandeur tried to wipe them out.<br>   <dd>  I guess you could say what goes around, comes around.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> "...and they [the Israelites] smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land." -Numbers 21:35<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A>  Yeah it's a redundant, but so is "Final Solution".<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#165;</A> Yes.
