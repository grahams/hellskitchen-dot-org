Stores advertise for holidays as if they were things that lasted longer than one day. It's like stretching Chanukah for half the year and Passover for the other half. From September on the year is a perpetual holiday; "Back to School" (you didn't know that was a holiday did you?), Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day, Easter, Mother's Day... continuing ad infinitum, right?<br>    <dd>  There's one small problem with that though: the only real holiday of note between Mother's Day and "Back to School" is Ascension Day, and that won't cut it because it's only five days after Mother's Day. Even department stores can't feasibly justify advertising for "Back to School" in May or June when most lower grade schools haven't even finished yet. If they tried that they'd probably get attacked by a mob of angry kids armed with glue sticks. Independence Day and Flag Day just aren't strong enough to hold up the entire summer by themselves, what with the higher apathy level. The only reason people go all out for so many of those other holidays is because if people can't manage to let off some steam somehow they're all going to blow. In the summer, the holidays are lacking because most of the people have more time to rest so they don't need any stupid holidays cramping their style.<br>    <dd> At this juncture in the holiday gap, the department and grocery store seasonal sections slip up; they end up showing you what life would be like if there were no holidays. In stead of another holiday, stores deck their halls with lawn jockies, bubbles, barbeque equipment, and the ever charismatic pink flamingo (tastefully hidden behind a few gnomes and a bird feeder).<br> <dd>    After discovering what we would be putting up with without holidays I think I am far happier with large paper pumpkins, plastic Santas and purple marshmallow bunnies than the alternatives.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mints.html">Other After Dinner Mints in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
