The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>May 19-25</B> is<B> St. Andrew Bobola</B> (<B>May 21</B>). St. Andrew was a Polish Jesuit in the 17th century who spent his years trying to reconcile the Orthodox Church and the Holy See (Papal Authority). Being involved in negotiations to resolve the schism apparently created enemies for our saint, and they sought their revenge at Janov near Pinsk. Andrew was accosted by a broguish band of Cossacks; they beat and tortured him, partially flayed his skin from his body and, when he continued to call out the names of the blessed mother and her sandal-clad son, removed his tongue through the back of his head. His nickname among schismatics was Duszochwat (robber of souls).<br>    <dd>  Other martyrs of note this week include <B>St. Pudentiana</B> (<B>May 19</B> (one of those Roman maiden martyrs, except that the Church announced in 1969 that she was fictitious (her name means "she who ought to be ashamed of herself" in Latin))), <B>St. Ethelbert</B> (<B>May 20</B> (was visiting a neighboring kingdom to seek the hand of a princess in marriage when he was deviously killed (it involved hidden trap doors!) and his land annexed) and <B>St. Julia</B> (<B>May 22</B>). A maiden of Carthage who was sold into slavery by the Vandal conquerors, Julia was crucified in Corsica when she refused to partake in the pagan festival being celebrated. While not a martyr, the patron saint of scholars (<B>St. Bede</B>) happens to have his feast day on May 25-the graduation/commencement day for RIT this year. Coincidence? I think not. It's the first sign that the Art School is secretly being replaced, not  merely eliminated, with a seminary or perhaps full-fledged Oral Roberts satellite college.
