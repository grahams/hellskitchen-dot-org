We had hoped to initiate a new format for the Predator, but there was a breakdown in communication among the people who knew what was going on and the people who were in charge of the printing.<br> <dd>    If it helps, look at it as the "Limited Edition Left-handed Melancholy Predator." Save those puppies...they'll be worth big bucks.<br>   <dd>  Speaking of bucks...<br> <dd>    With the end of the year fast approaching, we've recieved various questions and concerns about subscriptions. If you are graduating, transfering, or have just seen the Hell's Kitchen publications on the WWW, we offer yearly subscriptions now. One year consists of at least 30 issues, at a cost of $24. That sound like a lot, but at the end of a year, that is 240 pages. Plus it helps us stay in print.<br>	<UL><LI>	 Printing cost 5&#162; a page<LI>		 32&#162; stamp<li>		 That means every issue costs 72&#162; to print and mail.</UL>  <dd>    For each subscription, we make just over $4.00 profit. Bad for us, good for you. Trust us...it's a good deal.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
