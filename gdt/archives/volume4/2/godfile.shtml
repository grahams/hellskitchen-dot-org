There hasn't always been the idea of a Paradise: people sitting around, eating peeled grpes, playing with androgenous angels and whatnot. Most people assume that because Christianity and all of its bastard children have an afterlife that is just a softer, cushier version of what we have here, most religions had a world of bliss. I could go on and say that this isn't true; I actually thought about talking about Valhala a little, but I've a more interesting topic.<br> <dd>   The concept of a better world waiting for the pious necessarily degrades this world. In comparision to any hypothetical Paradisic world, this world becomes substandard, a lemon, a 1973 GL with all four fenders made from screening and unsanded Bond-O, painted green, black, and blue to cover various repairs, and the alternator held together with Duct-tape; in short, it sucks, and should be treated accordingly.<br>    <dd>  I don't think it is any coincidence that the sterotyped "right-wingers" are supporters of the Christian Coilition, relaxed environmental laws, and "Right to Life." Hey, let's strip that ozone layer, jack up the population density, and make everyone Christian. That way, once we sufficate in our own waste (only if we are not killed by roving bands of starving people after the planet's ability to support our massive numbers has been exceeded) at least when we all die, we'll all go to Heaven.<br>  <dd>   If the meanwhile, as we all whittle away the time waiting for the coming crash, we can enjoy sprintime walks in the soft acid rain, the sound of cany wrappers blowing in the fall winds, and the sunsets made all the more vivid by the increase of particles in the atmosphere.<br>   <dd>  And who's to say we'd keep Heaven so clean? A lifetime of habit can be hard to break. Can't you see it? Heaven is now studded with smoke stacks; but the standard of living is skyrocketing.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/godfile.html"> Other God Files in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
