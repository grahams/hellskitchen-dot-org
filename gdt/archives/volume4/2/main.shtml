National Secretary's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Hairy- Man- in- an- Old- Moth- Eaten- Overcoat- Who- Smells- Like- He- Runs- With- the- Yaks Day. How do people get days assigned to them? Draw straws? Pick numbers ("This week's Lotto jackpot is up to one national holiday")? Is there actually some lame government agency whose sole purpose for eating our tax dollars is to hand out official days? If there truly is such an useless agency, GDT has a suggestion: We would like to honor that proud and exclusive crew who boldly call themselves the "cry for help"-ers. Hell, they shouldn't just be given one day, there should be an entire month..."National Cry for Help Month" when all the closet call for helpers come out and show the world the true meaning of their pseudo-suicidal tendencies.<br>   <dd>   Why shouldn't we honor the growing number of "it was a cry for help" people? You know who the "cry for help" people are. They're the ones who try to overdose on children's Tylenol and laxatives. The ones who think about slitting their wrists in a manner that won't leave a permanent scar. They don't actually want to kill themselves. I mean by the time one of these guys figures out a convoluted plan of "attempted suicide" that would make any member of Mission Impossible weep with joy from the subtle intricacies included any self respecting suicidal maniac has already shown the world just how long their entrails really are after committing hari-kari with a number two pencil while dangling out a twenty story window (lead poisoning and disembowelment...what a way to go. "Do not colour outside the circles!").<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    In my middle school, suicide attempts seemed to be a rite of passage. If your voice hadn't changed and you hadn't pierced a major artery in the presence of a friend, (somebody had to know didn't they?), you had not yet experienced the true trauma that is adolescence. People used to brandish their war wounds as signs of honor, as if surviving, not five, but six attempts on their own life could show the significance of their life's inner struggle. All that shows is that they are incredibly incompetent.<br>    <dd> Those people who couldn't find a handy friend on location at the time would call them up to tell them, sometimes on a weekly basis. They would say such things as, "Don't tell anyone." (Well aren't they going to know after the fact?), "Don't try to stop me." (Why did you call?), "I just wanted you to know" (and the other half of the seventh grade. It's not as if you're not going to notice that your friend is dead).<br>  <dd>   Meanwhile the person sitting at the other end of the line is running through another rehearsal of the lines they have to recite at least once a month while calmly meandering through the latest issue of Seventeen magazine. The steady monotone droning on: "No. Don't do it. I'll miss you. Please, don't do it. We all need you." All of this emerges with about as much emotion as an airline stewardess marking the nearest exits...but with fewer hand signals. They sit there checking their watch wondering, "How much longer is this going to be? Don't they know I have practice at three?"<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images2/1.3.gif"><br><dd>     When I was growing up my parents taught me a couple things:<br> <UL><B><LI>     You don't have to like it you just have to eat it.<LI>     If you're going to do something, do it right.<li>     And when I'm speaking  sarcastically to my father it's called being "sassy"; when he does it, it is his god-given right.</B></UL><br>  <dd>   Most of this is unimportant with the exception of, "if you're going to do something, do it right." Much like the incomprehensibility of thousands of foiled assassination attempts on a moose named Bullwinkle, you have to stop and wonder: just how incompetent do you have to be to successfully survive six suicide attempts? Then again, I suppose they wouldn't call it attempted suicide if it was actually successful.<br> <dd>    So to sum it all up dear friends if you are so lame that you can't even manage to kill yourself, ask a friend to do it, or better yet, contact the professionals at the Church of Euthanasia care of Rev. Chris Korda, coe@netcom.com. The next time you call for help, check their credentials and their attempt:death rates. Chose only the best.<br>   <dd>  Oh, and keep your local coroner amused...die strangely.<br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
