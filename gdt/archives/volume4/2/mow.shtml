The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for<B> March 24-30</B> is the little known <B>St Alkelda</B> (<B>March 27</B>). Very little is known about her, and what is known is somewhat conflicting. Alkelda seems to have been an Anglo-Saxon princess who was either strangled by a pair of Danish women or (as an ancient painting represents) was strangled by Danish pirates (arrgh!). Two Yorkshire (England) churches are dedicated to our Saint. One, in the town of Giggleswick, has a holy well in whose waters the faithful seek solace from eye troubles.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
