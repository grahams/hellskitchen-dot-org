If you should try it, let us know how it goes.<br>			<dd>	-GDT<br>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>Date: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 22:17:44<p> Okay, everyone....a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A.  Thought y'all might enjoy this; if nothing else, it shows internet  justice, if it can be called that.<p> My daughter & I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe  in Dallas & decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are  such cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, "I'm afraid not."  Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, "Yes."  I asked how much, and she responded, "Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to my tab.<p> Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.  As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00." Boy, was I upset!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was "two fifty," and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a cookie recipe.<p> I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the bill would stand.<p> I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back.<p> I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to it  that every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "I'm sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even," and I will.<p> So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free.<p><TABLE><tr><td valign = top>2 cups butter<br>2 tsp. soda<br>5 cups blended oatmeal**<br>2 cups brown sugar<br>1 8oz.
