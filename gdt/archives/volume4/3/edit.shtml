The delay was caused because the person who has to pick the issues up from the printer on fridays actually forgot until there was nothing she could do about it. The issues were printed up, we just couldn't pick them up until 8:30, monday morning. We do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.<br>   <dd>  On a different note, GDT would like to thank managed attrition for making life interesting.  If any of you remember the colloquial contest and the fifty dollars promised to it's winner, rest assured that RIT is not prepared to make this easy for him. Right now GDT's printing costs are being covered by the remnants of the grant we were given by the RIT Creative Arts Committee, but that won't last long. After much haggling with our contacts working for RIT, we managed to get them to agree to give the winner a check out of our funds. The check was supposed to be given to the winner a while ago, but thanks to the great god of managed attrition, Rit has wisely cut it's check writing department down to two people.
