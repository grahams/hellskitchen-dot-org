I know what it's all about. But you know, I've done one better - a religion for me and me alone:<br>  <dd>   Godism.<br> <dd>    Ask any Christian- God made all that is, was, will be, is pretty much the most powerful entity going- and they'll all respond in synchronimity- bobbing their pious brows "Oh, yeah."<br>   <dd>  Here's one better:<br>  <dd>   The universe, for all its vast expanse (it's really quite big) is just too orderly to be one big accident. Let's face it, only the most dominating, controlling forces can keep it all in order. It's not a soup simmering in a pot, or a lava lamp of the gods; it's a clock. Never ending, always repeating, in a predetermined order.<br> <dd>    Therefore-<br>   <dd>  My every action, thought, word or whimsy, even my best jokes, all come from God. That's inspiration! My thoughts equal God's thoughts. It works for me 'cause you can't prove to me that you exist. Therefore, I can do or say anything because God wants me to. You think if he didn't I would still be able to do it? What are you saying, that I'm better than God? My will is greater than his? You phucking heathen!<br>  <dd>   The Catholics have operated on the same system for centuries, only I turned it up. The pope's still waiting for the bush to tell him he's wrong." Ok God. If I don't get a sign not to, I'm gonna eat that cheese-cake."<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/godfile.html"> Other God Files in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
