Everyone except Damn) of Gracies Dinnertime Theatre are horrible spellers. With such outstandingly miserable spellers, we all have a psychopathic hatred of one particularly loathsome human being. A smeggy lexicographer from the early eighteen hundreds, who has plagued stenographers since the dawn of his era. Do you know how infuriating it is to spend your entire childhood caught up in circular logic?<br> <dd>    "How do you spell quadragenarian?"<br> <dd>    "Go look it up."<br>  <dd>   "How do I look it up if I can't spell it."<br>  <dd>   The horror...the horror! Anyone who has gone through this can understand exactly what I mean. The impact upon all our childhoods was made even more nightmarish when They&#153; made us sit idlely by while They&#153; mocked us with that stupid, oh so cute, midget on TV. Ohhhhh how I yearned to squash that 40 year old under my size 4 sneakers (Come on, I was young...).<br>  <dd>    I pine for the age of Chaucer. I'd trade my thesaurus for those days. Well, maybe not. I mean, the Thesaurus is after all a top predator (favorite prey: Stenonychosaurus. Of course the various Thesaurus species have decreased in stature since the late Cretaceous period when they could get to be over 20,000 pages in length. Arguments still rage as to whether these ancient predators were hard or soft bound, however). It's so handy to have around when I just have to get rid of old, horribly written books. Especially the ones that tend to inhabit the Best Sellers List ecosystem. Let's face it folks, 90% of the population thinks that top ten lists (a la Letterman) and fart noises are the apex of humor. This means that any book that makes it to the best sellers lists is probably of no value at all.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Sure, there are books on those horrid lists written by incredible authors, but chances are they made it there on word of mouth based on their past books. All in all, you're talking about a bunch of literary epicack. Case in point... The Celestine Prophecy. Holy Christ. I read it, and it had some interesting ideas (though not very original) but the style was abhorrent. It read like a long dialogue. Maybe Mr. Redfield intended to mimic the style of Plato. My advice to Mr. Redfield would be to actually have some superlative original philosophical ideas and then to act like the Plato/Socrates communal being (feel free to try the hemlock tea), otherwise get some nail polish remover and unglue your pinky from the quotation key.<br> <dd>    You'd probably be better off if you didn't read any book in the top ten. Actually, you should be careful of any book you read. It's commonly said that people hunger after knowledge, but what is not known (or maybe it is known but is hushed up) is that knowledge hungers after people (This is actually where black mass gets its power from. They don't really worship Lucifer, they worship the books<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a>). Books want people to read them; need people to read them. The more a book is read, the happier it is. But old books, those dry and crumbly manuscripts, clay cuneiform tablets, fragments found in caves near the Dead Sea...all these are so starved to be read they can induce literary addictions in those who are foolish enough to begin reading them. Many a poor researcher has gone into an antiquated library and never returned.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    The ancient, starved grimoires got them.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a><br> <dd>   Libraries, because of their very nature, are some of the most dangerous places on earth. The ancients knew this; that is the real reason that the libraries at Alexandria, and later at Tripoli were burned flat ("Every book burned enlightens the world."- Ralph Waldo Emerson). To wander about in a library is to take your life into your own hands. Librarians know this. That's why they are stereotyped as being single (because of the constant threat on their lives) and are always insisting on silence. Maintain your silence when wandering the labyrinthian corridors of libraries, lest you attract the attention of the starved texts.<br>   <dd>  When night falls and the shadows grow long, that is when rogue packs of books, loosely organized into what we would call shelves, hunt for unsuspecting readers. They home in on sound, and when your back is turned, they sneak up behind you and...CRACK! They present their most luscious spines to you.<br>   <dd>  Ahhhhhhh, what the hell. Succumb to their siren song. It can be fun.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="3"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> This actually applies to most groups with any sort of holy text. Christians, Jews, Muslims, lawyers, bla, bla, bla. Of all the groups, it is the Christians that have the greatest weight to bear; there are more Bibles in the world than any other book (so the propaganda goes). If everyone were to just stop reading the Bible, can you imagine the devastation? The earth dark with frenzied packs of roving Bibles hunting for readers.<font color=blue>&#131;</font color><br>   <dd>  The Bible is a terrible predator, sapping your will and judgment. Thank you, Christians, for making the world safe for the rest of us sinners.<br><BR><font color=blue>&#131;</font color> If this footnote doesn't make much sense, try reading the rest of the article, and then visit here again.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#167;</A> Many of these old texts don't intend to kill their readers (it's self defeating, isn't it? I mean, the best adapted parasites don't kill their hosts). They are so out of practice that they have forgotten how to be parasites and have adapted to a predatory life style.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
