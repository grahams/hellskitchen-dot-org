May I shed a little light on one of the many bizarre things ye shall encounter on your journey? The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>March 31-April 6 </B>is the beloved <B>St Irene </B>(<B>April 3</B>). Irene was one of three sisters arrested in Macedonia for the unfortunate crime of possessing Holy Scriptures (such tripe was illegal at the time; now you can't burn the stuff fast enough...). When the governor, Dulcitius, (drunk as he was) attempted to defile the sisters in their dark cell, the trio tricked him into kissing kitchen utensils (maybe it was one of those special cells, y'know, the ones with a breakfast nook). Two of the sisters (Agape {charity} and Chionia {snow}) were immediately burnt at the stake. Irene, like so many before her, was sentenced to be deflowered in a brothel. Like all other virgin martyrs before her, she emerged unscathed from the ordeal. She didn't manage the same feat after she was tied to a pillar and shot through the throat with an arrow. Irene's name means peace (she is, surprisingly, the Patroness of Peace) and there is supposedly an Icon of our Saint in New York City that weeps real tears in time of war (it must never stop).<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
