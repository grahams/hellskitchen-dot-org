Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!"<br>  -<I>The Scarlet Letter</I>, Nathanial Hawthorne</B><p>  <dd> Each day millions of people across the face of the globe pray for salvation. Yet, how many of them rob from their friends, lie to their loved ones, and commit atrocities against Life, then beg for forgiveness to be let through the gates into Paradise upon their Judgement, only to commit the same acts the next day? They are sinful, but yearn for the bliss of Heaven. In true humbleness, they prostrate themselves before their Lord...their God.<br>  <dd>   As a rule, organized religion has accommodated their piousness by outlining a sanctified path to salvation; simply by living one's life by what is outlined, one can achieve Paradise.<br> <dd>   However.<br>  <dd>   People digress. they falter. They fail.<br>  <dd>   They sin.<br>   <dd>  They are, after all, only human. So they ask for forgiveness...which is often granted. God is a forgiving god...in the eyes of most.<br>   <dd>  It is not only guilt of sin that drives people to seek forgiveness, but fear. At the polar opposite of Heaven is Hell. In theory, Hell need not even exist. hell could be no more than non-existence and evoke feelings of dread in most. The Epicureans solved that problem, so Hell is Punishment.<br> <dd>    My point is this: people live their lives in a fashion that will allow them to achieve a hypothetical heaven, all the while denying themselves; all the while, living a lie.<br>  <dd>   Such hypocrisy! What God would welcome hypocrites into His Kingdom? Though Charles Manson sinned against Life, he is among the blest.<br>   <dd>  He was pure and true to himself.<br>  <dd>   Live your life, not to achieve a Heaven you may or may not deserve, but as you really want to live. Accept the consequences for your actions and enter Heaven without the blemish of Hypocrisy.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/godfile.html"> Other God Files in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
