Recently we were rummaging through our old material and stumbled over our first hate mail letter and read through it. To our honest surprise we discovered that our assailant was none other than one of the world's greatest seers into the future or he had just caught the luck virus. Follow through the letter and we shall elucidate it's subtle intricacies.<br><center><hr width = 40%><br></center><B><font size=+1>"Gracies Slandertime Brainwash.."</B></font size><br> <dd>    Hello... I'm writing this letter in regards to your "publication," "Gracies Dinnertime Theatre."<br>  <dd>   Did you ever ask yourself why The Reporter didn't let you publish that? Did it ever occur to you that journalism, at least in theory, is not based on opinions, but on facts? Did you even read your own publication? It's no surprise that they didn't want it in their newsmag.<br>  <dd>   First off, you must be one hell of an insecure individual. Not only is this "publication" sexist in the highest degree, you speak as if you're perfect. As if you're ALLOWED to condemn people, and pronounce judgement upon them, based upon how they choose to express themselves.<br>   <dd>  Let me ask you this- has that woman ever told you to fuck off? Has she ever accosted people preaching a message about world peace, or environmentalism? Is she outside your room pounding down the door, telling you to "repent, repent?"<br>  <dd>   I don't think so. Why ever she does what she does is her business, and her business alone. You have *no right* WHATSOEVER to slander her, especially in a public write up. According to the first amendment, this type of bullshit is punishable by Law.<br>  <dd>   "Yeah, it's always funny to laugh at people, it's funny to put down people... I feel great when I make people feel like shit, it makes my balls feel big." Is that what you say after you distribute this garbage? You're just another typical RIT asshole. Did you ever study your history? Ever read anything about World War II and the Nazi's? Most of the jewish race getting annihilated, and things like that? Remember reading about that? Is that what you're trying to start up here?<br>    <dd> And don't tell me this publication is "just a joke," or "You're taking this way too seriously." Because THIS garbage is no joke.<br>   <dd>  I could say more, but I'll save it. I think you get the picture.<br>-Dave<p><center><hr width = 40%><p></center> <dd>   In the paragraph that begins, "Let me ask you..." Has the barefoot girl ever told the author of said article to fuck off? Why yes, I have, but how did he know? Have I ever preached world peace or environmentalism? Logic tells us that because the word "or" was used only one part of that sentence need be true to make the entire statement truthful, and as it so happens, huh, I started writing "From the Corner" last quarter giving advice on, wouldn't you know it, environmentalism. As for that question about pounding on the author's door shouting, "Repent! Repent!" it was more of a knock and it was only because Dave gave me the idea in the first place, but yet it still happened. Kind of creepy isn't it.<br>    <dd> As final proof of Dave's ability of foreshadowing I have to site his quote, "Yeah, it's always funny to laugh at people, it's funny to put down people... I feel great when I make people feel like shit, it makes my balls feel big." How could he have known if not for his great abilities that we were going to adopt that exact quote as our creed to be stated prior to each meeting when we prepare our issues for distribution.<br>   <dd>  With abilities like that we can really over look such things as, "the jewish race", it's sort of like talking about the christian race, but excuse me my slanderous comments and do not consider me a non-believer.<br><dd>-The Barefoot Girl and the GDT Staff<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
