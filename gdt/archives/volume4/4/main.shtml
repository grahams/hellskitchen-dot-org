For those of you not familiar with it, we were accused of being Nazis for that literary giblet. We are neither Nazis, nor do we endorse Pat Spew-cannon (Go Pat Go) for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination (one of the founding members of GDT, however, is known as "Little Hitler" in particular circles). It was only after our attacker realized that the bare foot girl was a member of our staff that he knew he looked like a jerk-off to us. Since that time, GDT has expanded onto the World Wide Web and has received numerous e-mails concerning that one short article, all asking if she exists.<br>   <dd>  That one article is GDT's single most popular piece. There is an appeal to her that we can not fathom nor care to. She is not charismatic nor particularly pleasant to people, yet they adore her. Why?<br> <dd>  We have spent long sleepless days and wakeless nights pondering this question. I think we understand now, and offer you the opportunity to join the small, exclusive fold in the light.<br>   <dd>  The Cult of the Bare Foot Girl.<br>   <dd>  That's right. GDT now has an official religion. We're not worshiping the girl who just happens to be on our staff, but the entity of the Bare Foot Girl that is personified by her. Surely you've experienced the rapture of The Bare Foot Girl. Remember when you were young and ran about without any shoes...making fists with your toes in the sand at the beach...maybe running out into a slight dusting of snow, without anything on your feet, to check the mail. All these are times when the Spirit has ridden you (giddy-on little doggy). The spirit of the Bare Foot Girl can enter anyone at anytime, making their lives much more livable (and their feet much tougher).<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images4/1.2.gif"><br>  <dd>   There are so many reason to join in our worship of this aspect of the Nature Spirit. You can become The Bare Foot Girl (underoos available, batteries not included). No foolish dogma (yet. You can be a part of making it). Best of all, if we can get over 100 members, we can be recognized by the United States government as an official religion (as long as Go-Pat-Go isn't elected. Then there will be only one religion and only the revised Republican-Facist Party. All hail el Presedente).<br><dd>   In all honesty, we just wanted to trump up a reason we could bring back the concept of tithing. Hey, we need the money, you're all guilt ridden with your imagined sins; lets get together. We'll forgive you your sins, so you can go sleep with your best friend's girl/boy-friend and cheat on all your tests. We even offer affordable rates and no bothersome "Hail Mary's." Best of all, it's tax deductible!<br>    <dd> Now, here are some sage words from The Bare Foot Girl prophet:<br><dd>    When the idea of the Cult of the Barefoot Girl was first suggested to me, I laughed, in that typical arrogant manner that I have, but the idea has kind of grown on me, so I've made an appointment with my physician. Imagine it: a whole group of people working together to promote the ideals of the individual. How absolutely absurd. How unnecessary. How truly human. For those of you who find it important to have specific religious relics, we don't have any golden plates, only used plastic spoons, but we promise we won't lose them.<p><IMG align = right  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images4/1.4.gif"><br>    <dd> Oh Shit. We've gone too far haven't we. We're in the land where nothing is funny now. Not seriousness, but Non-humorous. We're even beyond the point of fucking with your mind. Only resentment and paranoia can be found here..so what the fuck do you want of us!<br>   <dd>  It's so cold here...cold and pink. The colour of magick is beyond purple, infinity is blue (as is humor, by the way), seriousness is grey, but the land of Non-humor is pink.<br>    <dd> What a weary people are the Nonhumarians. Those soft, silent creatures who stare out from their pink, fleshy faces as you try to amuse. Here, jokes actually can be heard when they hit the floor.<br>   <dd>   In the distance is a great standing form, dark against the sun. It's so familiar, so...oh my God...it's full of stars.<br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
