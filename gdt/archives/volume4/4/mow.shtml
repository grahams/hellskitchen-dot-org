The <B>Martyr of the Week </B>for <B>April 7-13</B> is <B>St. Stanislaus</B> (<B>April 11</B>). Stanislaus Szczepanowsky was an 11th century Bishop of Cracow who had a long standing feud with his King. Stanislaus objected to the King's extramarital philandering and for this was accused by the Monarch, Boleslaus the Cruel, of stealing land from a peasant, who was, at the moment, deceased. Our saint prayed fervently for three days and then went to the graveyard and summoned forth the corpse of the citizen in question. The decaying witness accompanied Stanislaus to court where he testified that he had indeed been paid in full. The feud ended when King Boleslaus, under threat of excommunication, entered the cathedral in Cracow during the middle of the Eucharist in High Mass and hacked Stanislaus to pieces with his sword. For many years afterward the coffin of our saint gave off a delicate fragrance (thus proving his holiness). It is contended by modern Polish historians that Stanislaus was actually killed due to his part in a plot to overthrow the king (but we all know that conspiracy theories are the crutch of all revisionist historians).<br>	<IMG align = right width=150 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images4/martyr2.gif"><br><dd>   Other Martyrs of note this week include <B>St. Hedda</B> (<B>April 10</B>).. St. Hedda was the Abbot of a community of monks near Peterborough in England. In the year 869 the same wave of Viking attacks that claimed the life of St. Edmund (Nov 20) also claimed the lives of St Hedda and 84 monks in his abbey.<br>     <dd> While not  a martyr, <B>St. Gemma Galgari</B> (<B>April 11</B>) was one of the rash of female mystics that the Catholic Church saw at the close of the 19th century. Due to her poor health St. Gemma was never able to become a nun. She did however exhibit the signs of stigmata (her hands, feet and side regularly "gushed" blood), the wounds of the crown of thorns and those of Christ's scourging. These blessed gifts were so severe that her bones were exposed and her hair regularly drenched with blood. At the age of 25 Gemma died of tuberculosis, her arms outstretched, as if on the cross.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
