It was considerate of the Reporter to facilitate us by printing their worst issue to date. Distributed late and containing articles with no apparent ending, the editor-in-cheif had the gall to write an editorial entitled "Apathy," asking the readership to re-evaluate what they thought of the Reporter in an attempt to sway the popular opinion that it is no longer worth the paper it is printed on.<br>   <dd>  The Powers-That-Be at the headquarters of Hell's Kitchen recieved a copy of the issue in question and promptly sent out a letter to the Reporter and all Hell's Kitchen member publications in the Rochester area. Whether the Reporter publishes the letter or not, you get it here.<br><table border width=500><tr><td valign = top><multicol cols=2 gutter=8>Subject: The Reporter<br>Date: Monday, 9 Apr 1996 00:00:01<br>From: cdiablo<p>"Here at the Reporter we have a responsibility to be professional., and we make every effort to maintain a high level of quality."<br>	<dd>-Jason Curtis, Editor-in-Chief<br>    	   April 5, 1996  issue of the <I>Reporter</I><p>   <dd> I, and many of those who work with me, are students of irony. Take for example the April 5th publication of the <I>Reporter</I>. In the Letter from the Editor aptly entitled "Apathy" the resident editor-in-chief bemoaned the common sentiment that the Reporter is not a high quality publication, passing blame to the faculty. Like all individuals, he yearns for respect for the project with which he is involved.<br>   <dd>  However.<br>   <dd>  Respect is to be earned, not given; and once earned, it does not have a sort of grandfather clause granting it respect ad infinitum. Respect must be deserved.<br>   <dd>  Now let's examine the <I>Reporter</I> and determine whether it deserves the respect of its readership.<br>   <dd>  The April 5th issue of the <I>Reporter</I> appeared at drop sites on the 8th of April ( "Our entire staff learns how to meet deadlines..." -Jason Curtis). This minor delay in publication could be overlooked if it were not for the repetition of this pattern. Over and over again the <I>Reporter</I> has been distributed late...and in some instances, not at all.<br>  <dd>   Overlooking the sloppy punctuation and questionable grammar common in the <I>Reporter</I>, two articles in this issue, "Some Changes to the Computer Privacy Policy" and "Girl 6," were meant to be continued on additional pages but lacked any indication as to where the continuation could be found. Another two articles, "Spike Lee's Gotta Have It," and "Oliver Stone: Uncensored," proudly announced that the articles were continued on page 23. Unfortunately, page 23 consisted of interviews with a number of students on multiculturalism. All of the unfinished articles were concluded on page 28 (which, incidentally, had no page number printed)...a fact not mentioned anywhere in the colour coordinated pages of the<I> Reporter</I>.<br> <dd>    The last piece of evidence I have to present concerns the cover of the <I>Reporter</I>, featuring a very impressive graphic of the RIT logo comprised of flags of the world. Unfortunately, the symbol in question is no longer the logo for RIT; it was changed to "R&#149;I&#149;T" quite some time ago.<br>    <dd> So the task of you, the readership of the <I>Reporter</I>, is to determine if the <I>Reporter</I> is worthy of respect. Ignore the graphics, remove the plethora of ads, and subtract the colour format. Ask yourself: does the weekly (usually) evidence indicate a "...high level of quality?" If not, why support a publication unable to live up to its own standards.<br>  <dd>   Cease whining about not getting respect and do something to deserve it.<p>    <dd>    -Carissimus Diablo<br>   <dd>  	Head, Hell's Kitchen<br>  <dd>      -Sean Hammond and Kelly Gunter<br>  <dd>   	Editors, <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I><br>   <dd>     -B.
