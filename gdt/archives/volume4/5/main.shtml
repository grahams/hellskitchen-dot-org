Not the abstract, oh- look- at- how- the- beaks- of- birds- change- over- generations- in- response- to- drought, but the hard hitting, really important issues concerning human evolution. We've got to face it, humans are evolving (except for all the Christian Coalition Phanatics. THAT'S how evolution should work: if you're not aware of the concept of evolution, you evolve to a point that you can consider it. If you decide to disbelieve in evolution, it decides to not believe in you, and you stop evolving. So get the hell out of my way you, you Creationists you!), but we're not nearly as crafty as the ducks behind my old high school who managed to survive on diets which consisted entirely of discarded cigarette butts and used condoms (lots of protein in one of them things). The problem is the way we are evolving.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images5/1.3.gif"><br>   <dd>   It has been pointed out again and again that we, as a species, are really not all that great. We're like the decathletes of the animal world: we're the best mediocre creatures on the planet. We're not particularly big, or fast, we don't have claws, or teeth,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> or poison, or protective mimicry.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> Hell, even the fact that we have opposable thumbs isn't so hot. I know a cat that has double paws and it uses them to pick up pens and throw them at you when it wants attention (no shit. No, really. He just throws pens). At one point people were saying it was our intellect that separated us from animals, but recent studies have shown that animals as close as other apes, and as varied as dolphins and parrots possess both a human intelligence level and language abilities.<br><dd>  So what makes us so damned crafty? Imagination. Without imagination, we're just hairless apes hitting flashing buttons or using the clapper if we're a little lazier (as I sit here typing, my non-opposable thumbs getting in the way while my jutting brow ridge is blocking my view of the Commodore 64 monitor). Unfortunately, we're backing ourselves into an evolutionary crevice (wwwhhhhooooaaaaa...). Technology and the imagination (of Bill Gates. We thought this would be understood...) has led us to the front door of the "global village," and we're all just waiting till someone has the nerve to knock. Soon all information will be just a fingertip away; you think we're fat and lazy now, wait until your computer can double as cook and hospital orderly. In the global village any one idea can be spread across the entirety of the globe in a matter of seconds. As soon as you've had an idea, the world has it. Look at the advances in the rate of information transfer from, say, the British Isles to mainland America. First, a sailing ship: a few months. A steam powered ship would have cut that to a few weeks. Then the telegraph brought that down to a few minutes. Now, not only can I send information to individuals in Great Britain in a few seconds, but to Japan, Brazil, and just about anywhere that there is a phone jack.  In this sort of world why would original thought even be considered? Every new thought could be instantaneously spread across the world and become the world's thought. People will have less of an incentive to create original ideas. We as a species will eventually be relegated to merely recombining old ideas into as of yet unused combinations and any technological advance will occur merely as a product of centuries of creative inertia. <br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images5/1.4.gif"><br><dd> Don't believe me? Well I have one word for you. Suits. That's right. Suits. You know, the kind that are worn by business men All AROUND THE GLOBE. All business men, regardless of where they are, who they are, how much they earn or whether or not they can identify the Wall Street Journal in fifty paces or less can now be seen sporting the latest Armani suit jackets and the sharpest ties. As little as fifty years ago you could have traveled the world and seen a diverse collection of garments. Now, most counties treat cultural dress as a sort of costume that is worn only on special occasions.<br> <dd>    The last bastions of imagination lie in the "underdeveloped" countries of the world. Here, among the uncouth goat herders and simple farmers, where they have never used a computer in their life, fresh thoughts thrive. But thanks to groups like the Peace Corps, even these groups are disappearing. Sure, they are exposed to our thoughts, causing an overwhelming increase in the new ideas they have, but the western world simply classifies, codifies and tucks away any new thoughts received from their addition to the "idea pool."<br> <dd>Knowledge and perception go hand in hand. How we perceive the world dictates what we perceive as the truth, and what we see as the truth determines how we see the world.<br>   <dd>   So There&#153;. </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> Well, we just don't have fun teeth, like sharks(rows and rows of razor sharp friends), pit vipers(hinged, hollow,venom conduits of pain) and  narwals(yes, that is one mama-jama of a tooth)<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> Except for the amazing and absolutely dazzling mimicry enabled by uttering the magic words, "I'm a little tea-pot, short and stout,here is my..."<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
