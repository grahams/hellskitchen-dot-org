The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>April14-20</B> is <B>St. Peter Martyr</B> (<B>April 20</B>). Peter was born in Verona, Italy to Catharist parents who subscribed to the Manichaean heresy (it's an offshoot of Xianity that believed that their spiritual leader,Mani, had lived many previous  lives as  great spiritual leaders; Buddha and Jesus were two of his previous incarnations). Peter didn't follow in his parent's footsteps, but instead joined the Dominican order at the age of 15. He gained much fame preaching and performing miracles and was soon appointed to head the Inquisition at Lombardy. Not surprisingly, he specialized in condemning people who had believed in/belonged to/initiated heresies against the Church.<br>     <dd> During his travels across northern and central Italy he performed numerous miracles including cloud production, vanquishing the devil, the curing of scorpion bites, and the defeat of the Cathars in battle. Some interesting stories reveal the uneven temperament of our saint. Once, when some children were throwing stones from a building, he cursed them, causing the building to collapse and kill the offensive youths. When a man confessed to Peter that he had, in a fit of anger,kicked his own mother, he was told to cut off the offending limb. The man complied and Peter was kind enough to restore the appendage. Peter was martyred when the Catharists succeeded in waylaying him on a journey to Milan. He was stabbed in the breast and his head was cleaved with a large knife. <br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
