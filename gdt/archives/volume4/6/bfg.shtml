Remember the heavyset man with the mustache and spectacles pushing 60 or so?  he gave oatmeal to small children in the Quaker instant oatmeal commercial... ring a bell?  he also starred in The Firm as one of the bastard villains and got killed at the very end (whoops, i hope you've seen it...)<br></td></tr></table></center></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><IMG SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/bfg.gif"><br></A><table width = 200><tr><td valign = top align = right> <font size =-1>by Kelly Gunter</font size><br></td></tr></table><br><dd>   As I am the GDT staff's resident Quaker, I thought it only fitting that I should be the one to answer your challenge. You see, over the years I have been bombarded by insane and not fully thought through cultural stereotypes, all of which gild the true neuroses of Quakerism. First of all, I want you to breath deeply and clear your mind of all those tedious questions dealing with Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Amish. These four religions are not even remotely related, though my school mates seemed to think so. Jeesh...belong to one obscure religious group and you might as well join all of them.<br> <dd>    Grade school was hell on me; I was the only Quaker in a school where even "the boy who walked around with a bag on his head" was not the only one in school who actively practiced his religion, (they just usually didn't wear the bags on their heads). Every year in Social Studies or World History we would come to a chapter that dealt with Quakers, the teacher would find out I was one, and the questions would start. It's funny how all forms of logic get thrown out the window once you find out you're dealing with some religion that is obscure enough to have become quasi-mythical. It's like bumping into an Aztec (just before the club you and serve you up with tea and crumpets). I could be sitting in class wearing jeans, a bright red sweater, my hair down, having just said to my present the inquisitor, "No, you are thinking of the Shakers," and I would still be asked, "Aren't you guys supposed to wear those funny hats?", "Why aren't your wearing black?", and "Don't you always say 'thee' and 'thou'?" What am I supposed to do, look at them without laughing and say, "Yes, thine memory serves thee well?"<br>    <dd>  Other times I get the brainiac who insists that Quakers don't know what electricity is. What? Thou meanest that the school has not been illuminated by my own inner light all of these years? Then it would happen. In amongst all of this stereotypical drivel, the question I most dread to hear, the question that was like holding up a crucifix to a vampire: "You guys make a lot of oatmeal cookies don't you?"<br>  <dd>    In that instant, both William Penn and George Fox leap out of their aged graves screaming in unison, "Nooooooo!", but alas, the damage had already been done. The word was out. Yes, we make a lot of oatmeal cookies. All of that stuff about the inner light, the truth being more holy than the book, helping inmates in prison, and the availability of God to the common man is all a sham when compared to the great oatmeal conspiracy. It all comes down to oatmeal. God doesn't make himself available to Bishops, nor the common man. God is only truly there to those holy individuals who eat oatmeal, day in, day out. And if you're going to be eating oatmeal every. damn. day, you had better become pretty creative in preparation. The possibilities go far beyond maple and brown sugar. The oatmeal, rolled oat, and groat combinations alone are endless.<br>    <dd> It is not well known, but modern Quakerism had received a heavy blow from the once coconspirator corporation of Quaker Oats. Although benevolence and brotherly love have been pushed forward as our general dispositions by our PR people, this is not entirely on the level. The fact is that we couldn't care less what you may or may not do to another, as long as we, the Quakers, have cornered the market on God by our devoted consumption of steeped oat products. Unfortunately for us, several years back, Quaker Oats hired Wilford Brimley to be their spokesman, and all hell broke loose. Wilford Brimley not only showed how eating oats was healthy, but made it sexy as well. Because of this, Quaker Oats has cornered the difficult to control early-morning-eating demographic of ladies between 6-12 and over 64. Quakerism is now finding its religious footing faltering at the close of the twentieth century as more and more people begin to consume steeped grain products that have had an increase in their random particle motion outside of its original religious context.<br>     <dd> So if you'll excuse me, I have some delightful chilled groat gespacho soup to eat.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
