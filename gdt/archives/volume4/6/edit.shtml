Though many have come from our need to know, there are some that originate with a `zine called "Universal Monsoon." Put out by Harry F. Walter, one of our staff had come upon his surveys and liked the idea. If you'd like to get in touch with Mr. Walter (his real name is David B. Schere), you can write to:<p>	<dd>		<B>Harry F. Walter<br>	<dd>		809 14th Avenue SE<br>		<dd>	Olympia, Wa  98501</B><p><dd>     On a totally different topic, I'm sending out a message to our readers on the University of Rochester. We'd love to hear what you think of our attempts to amuse you. If you don't like the idea that most of our staff is from the Rochester Institute of Technology, than change it. If you are interested in joining the staff of any of our publications, get in touch with us. Otherwise you are in for more RIT biased material.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
