For those of you from away (anyone from Maine can appreciate that), the burned over district is the name given to the region of western New York where there were massive religious movements roughly between 1800 and 1850. Revival tents popped up like giant mushrooms from hell and great herds of people followed charismatic and not so charismatic people across the state. The only thing that was missing was brimstone (oh, here was plenty of fire), bloody rivers and Jesus himself walking down the isle towards the healers asking, "Can you help with this pesky cut on my side?"<br>  <dd>   The Millerites preached the end of the world, John Smith found some gold plates and founded Mormonism, Ann Lee turned her back on marriage and sex, and founded the Shakers (the craftiest group of people. If they were allowed to have children, it's the Shakers, not the Japanese that would be running things. Then again, maybe it was their NOT having children that had them strung up so tight that they just sat around and created things all day), Jemima Wilkinson built the colony Jerusalem near John Noyes' Oneida Community, the Fox sisters talked to the dead and started the modern spiritualist movement, Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians had various schisms, and a merry time was had by all. With all of this activity, it's easy to attribute it to religious mania that snowballed out of control, but there are some other occurances. Susan B. Anthony got together with a bunch of chicks and started the sufferegette movement, and Fredrick Douglas hit the scene preaching equality.<br>    <dd>  There was a single source of all these movements: God was indeed trying to communicate with the various bipeds living in upstate New York between 1800 and 1850 (a little later, some of the residual theological fallout hit New Hampshire and make Mary Barker Eddy fall on the ice). The numerous movements are so varied simply because each receptive individual had their own biases and agendas. It was like interference blocking parts of the signal. After 50 or so years of trying to get His point across, God finally left.<br> <dd>    Now we're all alone, left with only bits and pieces of His last message to us.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/godfile.html"> Other God Files in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
