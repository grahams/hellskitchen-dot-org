It is commonly believed that St. George was a Palestinian soldier who was martyred there  under the Diocletian persecution (circa 300 AD). He is venerated as one of the 14 holy helpers, as a model of knighthood, patron of soldiers and staunch avenger of women. There are numerous varying accounts of his legendary encounter with a dragon, which is actually a fairly recent fabrication originating in Italy.  The now classic version generally goes as follows: George, the young and handsome knight, must rescue a princess (she got the bad draw in the town lottery and/or she was dying in a castle from lack of water) who is being held prisoner by a dragon (either fire-breathing or poisonous-breath-spouting). George defeats the dragon with his lance, binds it in the princess's girdle and leads it through town instantly converting 15,000 people. An eastern version depicts our saint as a Hercules-like quasi-god who endures a series of tortures (ie running in red-hot shoes) and who miraculously recovers each night for the next day's task. A western account of the previous version has George as a Prince of Cappadocia who is tortured daily for seven years. His bravery in the face of this ongoing ordeal is so great that 40,900 people (including Empress Alexandria) are converted. Another, less noble, George story is also recounted. In this one George is a freebooting bandit who deals in black-market bacon and rises to power as a Primate in Egypt. This George is arrested and cast into the sea. As a side note, "Riding St. George"-that is sexual intercourse with the female on top (for those of you still dutifully practicing the missionary position) was long believed to be the method for siring a bishop.<br>  <dd>   Other martyrs of note this week include <B>St. Adalbert</B> (<B>April 23</B>), killed as a polish spy near Danzig in pagan Prussia in 997, <B>St. Fidelis</B> (<B>April 24</B> (Angry at his success in converting Protestants,  Calvinists turned the peasants against him by inventing a story that our saint was an agent of the Austrian Emperor. He was stabbed to death and dismembered in the church at Seewis, Switzerland)), and <B>St. Mark</B> (<B>April 25</B>). Mark (the evangelist, the gospel-writer, one of the twelve) was in his latter years the Bishop of Alexandria. It  was here that he was bound by the neck with a rope and dragged through the streets, imprisoned and strangled in 75 ad.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
