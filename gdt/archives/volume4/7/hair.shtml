He began talking about how the engineering students are in trouble because they run the risk of becoming too specialized in their major. The critical part the art students play in Als Bad Lands (see page 3 of GDT) is to provide diversity for the campus, so the engineering students can look to their side as they walk to class and see someone with long hair walking beside them.<br>    <dd> I think I heard a cricket at this point. The silence in the room was actually tangible as everyone had to stop and take a step back. I know that I was whispering inside my skull, "Please dear lord, let this be a metaphor for something. Please don't let him mean what I know he's saying." Of course he had to keep talking. I, and everyone else in that room who had been repeating that silent plea, could no longer block it out: he was indeed saying what we thought he was saying. In the wake of that aftershock, the room's ambient animosity level grew ten fold and threatened to percipitate out of solution.<br> <dd>    Simone eventually realized his folly and made a feeble attempt at saving his floundering position by saying, "Well I guess there are a lot of people in here with short hair." All was lost.<br>   <dd>  So, there it is. The pivotal role played by the art school community is providing engineering students some long hairs to stare at. 1300 students whose most important function in this institute seems to be stocking the grounds with freaks. I wonder if the experience we provide for the engineering students could be acknowledged on their resumes...<p>       <dd>   EDUCATION:1995-1999 RIT<br>     	<dd>	- saw and experienced deviants.<p>  <dd>   ...no wonder we're expendable.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
