The last time this happened was shortly after the Gulf War and led to the dismissal of RIT's former President Rose. It was big news at the time, finding it's way into national busy-body news mags and government watchdog publications across the country. You probably don't know what I'm talking about...allow me to elucidate:<p>   <dd>  Undoubtedly you have heard the rumors that the CIA is directly involved with RIT. Well, that is not a rumor. It is a fact. There are CIA contact people who are open about their positions on the campus as I write this. The CIA's involvement now is nothing but a shade...but an echo of it's former greatness. Back in the days when there was an Art School, even back when there was a Photo program, the CIA was God (or at least the agency RIT sold it's soul to, but they had the good sense to buy more than  a lousy dinosaur sponge for five dollars, or a couple of couches).<br>  <dd>   It was recently pointed out that it is the money that companies, such as Kodak contribute, that drive RIT. Well, if that is true, the CIA was a canister of nitrous oxide hidden under the hood. Between 1966 and 1975 the CIA openly gave the College of Graphic Arts and Photography approximately $200,000 in grants.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> These were open, transactions, there for anyone to see if they examined the books.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> Imagine the amount of money being trickled into the school through more subtle means.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images7/1.2.gif"><br><dd>  During the time Rose was President, millions of dollars were channeled into RIT and the RIT Research Corporation.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a> No great surprise that this was the Renaissance of RIT. The photo program at RIT competed for first in the nation for quality with RISD. No surprise, with courses being offered in satellite imagery, lock smithing (casting keys), and currency quality printing that RIT quickly gained credibility, not to mention channeling students from RIT directly into the CIA. It was reported that "30 RIT...students have gone to work just for the National Security agency and the Central Intelligence Agency." There was even a half-hearted joke that the millions in counterfeit currency that flooded into Iraq after the Gulf War to destroy their economy was printed at RIT.<br> <dd>    It wasn't until President Rose announced on February 15, 1991 that he would be taking a sabbatical to serve his country that the inrush of federal money into RIT was threatened. Apparently Rose's concept of serving "in an area that maximizes my military, educational, and management experience" consisted of helping the CIA devise new training methods for agents operating in a post Cold War era. What the hell does that have to do with the Gulf War?<br>  <dd>   Outraged at the deception, the students of RIT and the faculty who had long yearned to remove the CIA from RIT began a series of protests that eventually exposed the full scope of the entwinement between the two acronyms. Under pressure, the giggle gas finally gave way, Rose resigned, and since that time, the CIA influence has waned.<br>  <dd>   Huh, wouldn't you know it: a few year after the CIA was officially gone, the photo program was raped (rapere signum), much to the chagrin of the students. "Not enough money." Now, with Dr. Margret Lucas's policy of  strip mining the Arts College,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> all programs are threatened. The CIA no longer has a need for the college of Arts, and is cleaning up after itself. Another major building not connected to the others on the academic side is Computer Science, and their programs aren't being cut, that we are aware of. Perhaps they are still of use....<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images7/1.3.gif"><br>  <dd>   RIT, you shot yourself in the head when you exposed the CIA's involvement. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you, this school was built on the federal money pouring in from the CIA. When the CIA left, it took its affluent coffers with it and all that's left of it's former glory days is the shadow of the Japanese garden, governmental misinformation administration policies (information on a need to know basis only), and a poorly designed metal cat. Of course the programs offered in the various College of Arts are disappearing; the money that created and funded them had the metaphorical Orkin man set upon them.<br>  <dd>    We at Hell's Kitchen suggest we welcome the CIA back onto the campus. Let them return and shower us with their golden coins. Sure, the CIA have been called baby killers, but haven't we all?<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a> What it comes down to guys, is what is more important: keeping an organization responsible for plotting the assassination of foreign leaders and attempting to topple "unfriendly" governments, or have excellent education programs?<br>  <dd>   Write to the CIA and ask them to return to RIT, or talk to your local CIA representative. They are everywhere on campus. Maybe they are just waiting for us to ask them back. Well, here's your chance to welcome with open arms and have your mind laundered while you wait. It might be even more fun to let them give you a full cranium cleansing (with extra scrubbing bubbles); it's like spring cleaning for all of those non-essential idiosyncrasies and out moded beliefs (Christians, please form an orderly queue).<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A>   Incidentally, RIT was constructed on its current site with thoughts toward Riot Control. All those narrow openings between buildings, floor seven of building one being capable of shutting off all access (as some students discovered on Monday), and the interesting fact that building 7 is one of the few buildings on the academic side that is not connected to any other building; they did that because they knew that if the shit ever hit the fan, it would start in building 7 and they wanted to be able to contain it easily. Still, they'd never be able to get rid of the smell and dung beetles.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A>  Assuming, of course, the books didn't examine them first.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#167;</A>  Jennifer Hyman, "Millions in CIA Funding Pumped into CIA Coffers," Democrat and Chronicle, May 16, 1991, p.
