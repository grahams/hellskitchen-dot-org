Building 7 houses the School for American Crafts and the School of Art and Design, both of which are the subject of proposed program cuts. If these cuts are put into effect it will literally rip the creative soul out of the Institute. A large part of what makes an education in the arts truly worthwhile is versatility and the ability to experiment and dabble in diverse fields of study. It seems obvious that if this is taken away from the students they will be getting less of an education. What is the benefit of eliminating 5 of 7 programs in the SAD school? It is given that the money saved will be used to strengthen the remaining programs by providing better equipment and facilities. I ask what good that will do when the students coming out of such a program are stifled drones with little experience at expressing themselves, creators without creativity, artists without souls.<br>   <dd>   I believe that we are also reacting in exactly the way that the administration expected and planned. I'm sure that there were a few programs that the Academic review board did find lacking, programs that are either rapidly deteriorating or those in which there is little interest beyond the scope of an elective class. If the administration finds that these two or three programs could be eliminated to save money it needs a way to do it in which it will come out looking good. Why not recommend those programs along with some others that have minor problems , but that you don't truly wish to cut, to be discontinued. There will, of course, be a huge outcry from students and faculty against these proposed cuts. Numerous reasons why and how minor problems can be fixed or avoided are brought out from a now rallying student body. When the administration seems to compromise and only cuts two or three programs instead of eight it looks like it is accommodating student needs. Don't be fooled by the administration's feigned ignorance, this was all planned (though not as well as Iron Mountain).<br>    <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
