In the internationally known School of American Crafts, only 2 (count 'em - 2!) majors will remain: Metals and Wood. This undercuts the reputation of the school. Although these programs would be "phased out" -no new people admitted, but those in the program can go throught to graduation- the quality of professors would decrease, as would the facilities. Also, the degrees obtained by the majors seemingly not affected, would decrease in value. Prospective employers seeing that the individual went to R.I.T.'s School of American Crafts (SAC) or School of Art and Design (SAD), and would say, "Gee. That school was once reputable, but now they hardly offer anything. This person has not had a diverse education."<br>     <dd>   The concept behind the creation of R.I.T.'s two art schools was to mirror the ideals  of the Bauhaus. This included having many opportunities to explore new and different medias and options, with the ability to flow easily into a class not in one's major. Unfortuanately, with these cuts, the Bauhaus ideals are lost.<br>      <dd> Monday, 22 April, 1996, numerous students inspired by posters, flyers, and word of mouth, met at the Bevier Gallery. The meeting was moved to Building 1, where RIT's President, Al SImone, and the Provost, Dr. Stan McKenzie, spoke to the group. The feelings of unease grew as problems became more and more apparent.<br>   <dd>   Individuals volunteered to act as representatives from each major and met early the next day, 23 April. They discussed future plans, wrote letters, started an alumni chain, set up a table with letters for people to sign, and planned for the a large rally. The rally was held at 1pm between buildings 7A and 7B. After several student speakers, including an engineer who opposed the cuts, the rally was moved to the "Town" meeting located in Building 76. This meeting was run by the Dean, and was for the faculty and public. The Dean addressed many questions, although many who were there were not satisfied.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size><dd>Tracy Gilbert <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
