I just went in the side entrance (I guess we were supposed to get discouraged after seeing our first efforts turned away) and ran up the stairs.<br>    <dd>  The stairs stop at the 4th floor so I roamed around looking for another means of gaining altitude. I found a pair of elevators and soon so did another small group of students, a woman, some dreds, two kids with a camcorder, and a guy from the Reporter with a tape recorder.<br>    <dd>  So we were all waiting for the doors of the elevator to open (they took about 4 minutes) and there's this guy in a midnight blue suit jacket standing in the elevator jockey position next to the buttons. "Going down." I think was what he said when he saw us. Later on, "No one's allowed on the seventh floor," and, "You can't go up there," came too.<br>  <dd>    Dreds started turning on the asshole ray and hit him right between the eyes. He started arguing while the guy from the Reporter gleefully recorded: why can't I go up into the seventh floor? You mean I can't go into my own building? Well what if I go up to the seventh floor? You'll stop me? Well what would you do if I did? What are you gonna do to stop me? So if I tried to get to the seventh floor you'd assault me? You'll assault me if I go to the seventh floor?<br>  <dd>   At this time the other elevator opened up. I, and most of the crew jumped in. I was puzzled why the midnight blue suit didn't pay us any attention until I found out that the seventh floor button wouldn't light up; they had turned off access to the seventh floor. I hit #6 and it lit up, so we were off once again. We got out and started rooting about discretely for the back stairs (how discreetly can 4 kids with a camcorder root about?). One of the employees wandered out and the kids began preparing to interview her. She gave a no comment but grudgingly showed us the direction to the back stairs. We went as quickly as we could through the offices and ran up the stairs.<br>   <dd>   Locked. The 7th and 6th floor stairway doors were both locked, so we went back down to the 5th floor and then I finally departed.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/jf.html">Josh French</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
