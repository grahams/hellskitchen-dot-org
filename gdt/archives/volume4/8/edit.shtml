This means that the RIT staff of GDT and MP are under a lot of pressure. Last week was absolutely crazy, what with the news about the proposed cuts. Undoubtedly there was (Hey, I wrote this on Thursday, and I'm guessing) all kinds of fun stuff in the <I>Reporter</I>. News articles, cartoons, and all kinds crap in the Opinion section. Just remember this, friends and neighbors: GDT scooped the <I>Reporter</I>. HA!<br> <dd>    Speaking of the <I>Reporter</I>....<br>  <dd>   Did you notice all the letters of praise that the <I>Reporter</I> printed last week? Well, we haven't seen the letter the Head of Hell's Kitchen sent to the <I>Reporter</I> (with the blessing from the editors of the <I>Melancholy Predator</I> and <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>). Lucky for you we printed it (issue 5, volume 4). I guess the <I>Reporter</I> has to keep up appearances.<br>   <dd>  From its conception, there has been bad blood between GDT and the <I>Reporter</I>. We've provided a short list of highlights to the right.<br>   <dd>   In the meantime, we urge all of you that regularly read us NOT to submit anything to the <I>Reporter</I>. Nothing that is but criticism. Tell your friends, spread the word. Let's really piss those bastards off.<br></td></tr><tr><td valign = top><center><B>A Short Synopsis of the Blood Feud with the Reporter (with highlights):</B></center><p>January 1995: A prototype column named <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>, dealing with duct-taped Ethiopians, was rejected.<p>19 February, 1995: <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> begins to publish a one page weekly article.<p>12 March, 1995: GDT was banned from the dinning hall named Gracies.<p>26 March, 1995: GDT received it's first hate mail, convincing the founding triumvirate that they should publish more than their planned 5 issues.<p>2 April, 1995: First fan mail from a staff member of the <I>Reporter</I>.<p>Fall, 1995: The <I>Reporter</I> starts their "Opinion" section. Though we can't prove it, we think it was to compete with GDT.<p>Winter, 1995/1996: The <I>Reporter</I> begins to put phrases like "The shitty" before their title...kind of like what the <I>Melancholy Predator</I> had been doing.<p>Spring, 1996: A small addition to the Hell's Kitchen publication family, <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>, submitted an article to the <I>Reporter</I> for publication. It was printed under the title "Delusions."<p>5 April, 1995: The <I>Reporter</I> prints their worst issue ever. C. Diablo writes a Letter to the Editor and sends it to the editors of GDT and MP for their signatures. They then give the <I>Reporter</I> a copy. The editor of <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I> does not sign it.<p>Mid-April, 1995: The editor of the <I>Reporter</I> made it clear that <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I> was not to appear in the <I>Reporter</I> again...presumably because of it's affiliation with GDT and MP.<br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
