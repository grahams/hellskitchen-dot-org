I heard from other people that the tv news carried other quotes to that effect from him.  Over, and over again.<p>As one of the many engineering students with long hair, I can't help but wondering if Simone can actually handle that concept.  He seems, from what I have heard (pretty biased, admittedly) to have divided the campus community (such as it is) into two groups.  Engineering students, and people with long hair.  Crossover between these groups has potential to require him to make an adjustment in thinking (heaven forbid).<p>While I've taken this opportunity to ramble at you, I'd like to express my compliments to the entire GDT staff for another issue of refreshingly intelligent humor. Thank you, and please, please, keep up the good work.<p><dd>-John<p> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
