There are beings in the multiverse that can dip in and out of time and reality. Actually, they spend more time leaping about from reality to reality than stepping outside of time. Even They&#153; get the willies being outside of time. Once outside, time smells yellow, feels loud, and just overall makes you think that you're a water fowl. It has never been explained why this is....<p>  <dd>   Never the less, one of the more interesting features of the multiverse is that everything not only has the possibility of happening, but HAS happened. I mean everything. With an infinite amount of time and an infinite number of different realities, sooner or later, you're going to get repeats.<br><dd>So it was just a matter of statistics that one of our staff (for matters of anonymity, let's call him...Mark) would be seducing squirrels with a Snickers&#174; bar. It's an odd hobby; baiting squirrels to come close enough to club. Not to kill, mind you, just stun them. Of course there were years of experimentation and practice to work out the means and methods. Wiffle-ball bats move too slow. Steel bars just pulverize their little skulls. Elastic bands scare the bejeebers out of them. Over the years casualties built up, along with a field filled with shallow graves holding tiny, indistinct bodies (who look as if the last noise to flee their rapidly diminishing form was either an inrush of air far to large for their tiny lung capacities, or that tell-tale sound of gooey crackles, much like the sound emitted when driving a steam roller over a large wad of packing paper that had grape jelly substituted for the air pockets),  and notes...lots of notes.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/1.2.gif"><br><dd>  Eventually, Mark was able to faun in just the appropriate manner and the squirrels came. They came even when the ground around him was littered with the faintly twitching bodies of their stunned relatives. It was always the same. A squirrel appears, is coaxed close, and ends with the satisfying impact of rod with skull. But once, instead of the usual routine:  Closer. Closer...and...BAP!<br>    <dd>  Well, there was a dust devil...vaguely shaped like a surprised squirrel, then nothing. Slowly, Mark put his staff away and sat for a very, very long time.<p>    <dd> There are things that just happen. Your jaw will just start to hurt sometimes, or no matter what you do, your side burns never are the same length. That was the case with the squirrel. It just happened. Using the mighty resources of Hell Inc., we found  that conditions were just right to send that little fuzzy shit back through time before the big bang occurred. Of course, the life span of the extremely surprised quadruped in question was slightly under 20 seconds in the pre-Universe. With a temperature of 0 Kelvin, and no external pressure, the little bugger exploded and froze all at once, looking amazingly like a piece of reddish popcorn. Incidentally, this is why the temperature of the universe is just above 0 Kelvin. When the squirrel with its endothermic, though short lived, body appeared on the scene, the heat in the universe went from 0 to just above 0 Kelvin. I'm getting ahead of myself, though.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   Now, the funny thing is, there was bound to be a reality with the same general set of conditions. And wouldn't you know it? The whole place was anti-matter, complete with an anti-Mark and anti-squirrels. Of course some poor anti-squirrel got clobbered and "!PAB" it vanished. It actually went hurdling back through time and popped back into the time stream just before the Big Bang occurred.<br>   <dd>   It was only by freak eventualities that both squirrels ended up light years (but there was no light. In fact, there was nothing but two squirrels. Does that make it dark years? Maybe squirrel years: The amount of distance covered by 2 squirrels in a year?)  away from one another in that pre-Big Bang space. Anyone with basic physics under their belt is going to realize that two bodies of any mass will attract one another, and with only the Two Squirrels, there was nothing to deflect their course. For eons, the two entities slowly moved toward each other, gaining speed, becoming dark blurs against a field of nothing.<br>    <dd> Actually, it really wasn't all that spectacular to see. If you ever go to Mammoth Caves and go down to the lake and they shut the lights off, that's about how stunning it looked. Trust me though, they were traveling along at speeds that would make most physicists shiver and take a cold shower.<br>   <dd>  So eventually...<br> <font size=+5><center><B>"Q-FUCKIN' BOOM!"</B></center></font size><br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/1.4.gif"><br><dd>   Actually, there was no sound. Just a sudden increase in the amount of things to be seen, and in the amount of light to see them by.  As a matter of fact, everything suddenly got kinda bright.  Rather conveniently, matter and antimatter totally annihilate each other on contact, producing gobs of energy, so from the moment of contact, the view was much more interesting, then again watching a cow chew it's cud is more interesting than just waiting for two squirrels to collide, you can't see them, you can't even try to take bets.<br>    <dd>   The long and the short of it is, the entire multiverse came into existence when two squirrels ran headlong into one another.
