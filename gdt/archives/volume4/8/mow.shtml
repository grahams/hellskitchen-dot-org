The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>May 5-11</B> is the venerable <B>St. Gengulf</B> (or Gangulphus (<B>May 11</B>)). St. Gengulf was a respected Burgundian knight in the eighth century. Rumors that his wife was unfaithful to him were constantly being brought to his attention. He confronted her with these allegations, which she denied. In order to prove her innocence, he asked her to simply immerse her "chaste" arm in the well in their garden. When she complied the water boiled, scalding the adulteress. Instead of killing the unfaithful woman, as was his right, our saint removed himself and took up residence in another part of his castles. The scheming wife took advantage of Gengulf's merciful demeanor by sending her lover to hack him to pieces in his bed.Gengulf is the saint  invoked against Cuckoldry.<br>	<dd>Other martyrs of note this week include <B>St. Ava</B> (<B>May 6</B>); She was the only maiden spared of the 11,000 that traveled with St. Ursula (see Oct. 21). She was tortured and imprisoned by the Huns. When they decided to get rid of her, she was first thrown to the lions (who wouldn't touch her), and finally put to the sword. Her mutilated remains were put to sea in a stone boat that eventually came to rest in Brittany. Toddlers are dipped in the boat to help them develop strong legs. Another martyr this week is <B>St. Solangia</B> (<B>May 10</B>), a peasant girl who lived near Bourges, France. She resisted the advances of a local aristocrat's son and in retribution he stabbed her to death.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top><IMG width = 150 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/martyr1.gif"><br><dd>	The <B>Martyr of the Week Before</B> (<B>April 28-May 4</B>) was <B>St. James the Lesser</B> (<B>May 3</B>). St. James (known as "the Lesser" due to the fact that he was the younger of the two apostles named James) was a cousin of Jesus and, after our Lord's resurrection and ascension, became the first  bishop of Jerusalem. It is interesting to note how literally the people living at the time of X's ascension believed the prophecy that he would return very soon to usher in the new kingdom. As an example, St. James vowed to fast until the return of X. Our saint may well of starved to death had the dear Lord not paid him a visit  ( and cooked him dinner). James didn't have to wait much longer to see paradise; he was captured by Pharisees and thrown from a pinnacle of the temple in the year 62.AD. James lived long enough to grant forgiveness to his wrongdoers before he was either stoned or beaten to death with a club ( accounts differ).<br> <IMG width = 150 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/martyr2.gif"><br><dd>	Other Martyrs of note last week include <B>St. Zoe</B> (<B>May 2</B>  (Zoe, her husband, and their two children were slaves that happened to be Xian. When they refused to partake in their master's pagan rituals they were tortured and then burned alive)), <B>St. Philip</B> (<B>May 3</B>  (one of the big twelve, Philip was performing a public exorcism at which some of the spectators were killed by the beast being "cleansed." Among the casualties was the son of a local pagan priest who, as retribution, had our saint stoned and crucified upside down.)), and <B>St. Florian</B> (<B>May4</B>). An officer in the Roman army and a Xian- not a wise choice. Florian was repeatedly whipped, had the remaining skin flayed from his body and then was thrown into the Enns river (in Austria) with a millstone around his neck. <br><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
