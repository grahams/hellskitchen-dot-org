When we began publishing last year after being rejected by the <I>Reporter</I> with first one, and then two pages, our limited space requirements led to whole-sale slaughter of ideas; in same cases, as much material had to be discarded as was kept.<br>  <dd>   After a year of conditioning, we have had an extremely hard time overcoming our Skinner Box training ("Oh, I'm sorry..... That issue is too long." !ZAP! "Ahhh!"). With this issues, however, we had enough material to fill at least 2 more issues.<br>    <dd>  Anyway, here are some of the out takes from this week's issue. Enjoy.<p><font size=+2><B>The Squirrel Saga Continues...</font size></B><p><dd>    Even before the founding of Hell Inc., many of its founding entities were intimately aware that our universe was created by the obliteration of two tiny, unaware vermin, traveling at dangerously high speeds. For centuries the Hell Inc. staff in the Cronus Corporation have been trying to jump start the Big Bang (think of the glory, think of the prestige, think of the copyright infringements). The Cronus Corp. being a gentler, more caring company, wanted to add an extra little twist to creation of the universe (as if two squirrels traveling just under the speed of light isn't strange enough). For years the blue-collar workers of the corporation have been taking squirrels and sending them spiraling back through time with a AA mini-theater penlight strapped to their muzzles. The writing staff of Hell's Kitchen is still unaware of whether this was meant to be an additional perk, showing the furry little rodent where it would be going, or if it was intended to introduce the ill-fated  creature to the fact that within a relatively brief amount of time it would soon be careening at speeds now unimaginable to the human mind, toward a small sparkling light in the distance attached to a mirror image of its anti-self.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> Not that the neuroses of the Cronus Corp. actually matters too much in light of the fact that if those fateless little buggers even did make it back to the correct time,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> they'd only have a fraction of a second to contemplate it, and even then this time would most likely be filled with the squirrel equivalent of, "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"<br><center><IMG  width = 450 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images8/saga.gif"><br></center><dd>   From our vantage point at the end of the twentieth century, the physical dynamics of the pre-bang era are quite questionable. The incredible truth of this strange journey is that as the two squirrels traveled back in time toward the dawn of existence, they both started picking up excess mass and matter, much like the moon collects asteroids and Bert collects bottle-caps. At any rate, when they finally made it...they were huge. They were still squirrels, but squirrels you might think twice about before trying to shoo them away from the bird feeder.<br>    <dd>  They were galactic size squirrels.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a><br><dd>    Even being as large and as glorious as they were, with quite literally the weight of the universe on their backs, they still ended up looking much like a couple of freezer (and Christmas) ready Pop Secrets&#174;. All the matter in the universe can be traced to these two founding critters. In fact, that dark matter that physicists are so keen to believe in, much like a child might wish on a star, is there. It exists, but it might be better named "Squirrel Matter."<br> <br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="4"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A>  The concept of a flashlight in the mouth of a squirrel traveling at the speed of light predictably sparked a week long debate among the staff of Hell's Kitchen on the physics behind the idea. There were two factions (well, three. One group didn't see the point of arguing, since the little guys exploded and wouldn't be seeing much of anything): The majority felt the squirrel wouldn't see anything, where as the minority felt the squirrel would not only see the light from their flashlight, but any other light around them. After much debate, exchanging of formulas, and vague death threats, it was determined the question was phrased incorrectly.     Because no object with mass can travel the speed of light, the question has to be rephrased as "If a squirrel traveling just under the speed of light had a flashlight in its mouth would it see the light, or any light around it." Then, the answer is yes, though any outside observer would see in infinitely small point that is the squirrel...and no light from the flashlight.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A>  Though the time travel abilities of the administration of Hell Inc. are extremely advanced, the methods used by the various satellite corporations and divisions are shotty at best. The method currently in use by the Cronus Corp. can best be described as "the shot gun" method. The workers can not control when a squirrel will appear in time.<br>   <dd>  For eight hours a day, 5 days a week, the floor workers of the Cronus Corp (A section. The people working in C Section shove pens into rat's bums and shoot them into the future to bring about Armageddon. The less asked the better. "Just sign you're name here sir...". Presumably, B section sends some kind of furry mammal with a prostheses into the present (though they really can't tell. I mean, if you are time traveling into the present, you don't move a whole heck. Because of the apparently insane nature of the job, the workers in B Section are all Zen Masters. Heck, working in B Section is like living a Zen Koan)) talk with co-workers about who they are fucking and their damn kids while they stoically shove flashlights into the mouths of stunned squirrels rolling along a sort of assembly line (insert cartoon assembly line music). Eventually the squirrels reach the end of the line, and dissapear.<font color=blue>&#167;</font color><br><dd>   This has led to the embarrassing discovery of little mammal skeletons with corroded bits of zinc and copper in their mouths at various archeological sites and imbedded in the shale of many quarries. Of course, Hell. Inc.'s security division, Pandora, works diligently to insure this information is never released to the public at large. The only reason we are able to print it is no one believes what we print. Hell, people thought my After Dinner Mint about modifying IMB simms to work in Macs was a joke.<BR><font color = blue>&#167;</font color>  Along with the portion of the assembly line the squirrel was on. This has resulted in a massive recycling program, encompassing all of time and space.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#165;</A>  How's that? A one word paragraph consisting of only 5 words. Nothing like flaunting what you haven't got.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/ma.html">Michelle Amoruso</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/jf.html">Josh French</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
