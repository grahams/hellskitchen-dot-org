Sure, comments about the <I>Reporter </I>were always made during staff meetings; discussions on content, taking measurements on the amount of blank space present, lousy (though some would call it artistic) layout, etc.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#167;</A></a> Conditions have recently reached a head, however.<br>   <dd>  In April, the <I>Reporter</I> made the mistake of printing a horrible issue in terms of layout. Maybe you remember it.... It was the one that had articles that were not continued on the pages indicated (or not even indicated where the articles were continued). The head of Hell's Kitchen drafted a letter  which the editors of GDT and MP signed condemning the sloppiness of the <I>Reporter</I>.<br>   <dd>   Oh course, the <I>Reporter</I> never printed the letter.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> Maybe we should have expected it. What we didn't expect were the letters of praise they printed in an issue shortly after we submitted the letter.<br>    <dd>  Equally surprising was article entitled "Dick Tease" in the May 3rd, 1996 issue. Sounding vaguely like a justification for date-rape, the article in question was even more interesting because it was printed in the same issue as a story covering the Take Back the Night<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a> rally. Ahhh, irony.<br>     <dd> My point is, with a shoddy track record over the past several months, is the <I>Reporter</I> worth having? Or more accurately, can RIT afford to have the <I>Reporter</I> be the news publication that represents the campus to the world at large?<br>  <dd>   I am trained in Biology, and have a tendency to use biological paradigms. In my eyes, the Reporter was a successful organism in an environment for a time. That time has passed, however, and the organism is in decline. One of the most important rules for all Hell's Kitchen publications is "Evolve or die." Maybe the time has come for the <I>Reporter</I> to be swept aside for a new publication.<br>   <dd>  Competition can lead to excellence. Right now, the <I>Reporter</I> has no competition. To rectify that, I invite any one interested in starting a new, alternative news mag for RIT to contact us. We would especially need illustrators, photographers, and writers. Imagine how impressive your resume would look if you could say: "Helped form a weekly news publication at the Rochester Institute of Technology while destroying another."<br>  <dd>   Help us help RIT (and give the <I>Reporter</I> a hard time).<br> <br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#167;</A> Not that GDT, MP, or 10:1 (God rest its cute little soul) have a spotless track record. Far from it. I think the difference between the RIT based publications that are a part of Hell's Kitchen and the Reporter is that GDT and MP is mostly written and put together by Science majors. We don't pretend to know what a good layout is. We just try and make things look good, be creative, and speak our minds.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#165;</A> Lucky for you, we printed it a few weeks ago.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#164;</A> If you are not familiar with Take Back the Night, it is intended to call attention to violence against women...especially sexual harassment, rapes, and murders.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
