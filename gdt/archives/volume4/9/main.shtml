In the little known Alphabetic Era of Geologic Time (255 to 240 million years ago) letters roamed wild and free! Like the tyrannosaurs that could see based on motion and velociraptors that were civilized enough to open doors and hold up their pinkies while taking afternoon tea, these letters had characteristics all their own.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> The following are the field notes and observations of a poor shluck who just happened to be passing while one of our staff was seducing squirrels close enough to club:<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a><p><dd>   A is the prodigy of the group. Always at the front. But V is the evil (stress the V) twin of A. Other members of the family include U and W.<br><dd>   U and W are siamese twins, as are M and N. Both of these were separated at birth around the same time by their parents to avoid the public's disdain for freaks. There was a mishap during the operation, leaving w and m with two heads. The ensuing result was that they became close to enemies, producing only negative words, such as wuss and mnemonic---which brings every adult back to school days when teachers still whipped them with rulers and demigods. Ironicly, M is the lover of W; his egotistic narcissism forced him to chose a mate resembling himself.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images9/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>    O is nothing. Buddhist, Taoist. No mind. Nil. It is the perfect being. In opposition to O's comfortably rotund nature, B and D are less confident and try to hide their large stature by stuffing their forms into girdles of straight lines. C is close to achieving the oneness of O, and had, for a brief moment, realized perfection. At that moment, Q stole the missing piece from C, and is keeping it from perfection. <br><dd>   C, Q and U were in acquaintance once, but when Q stole the piece from C they split up; that's why you don't hear the word very often anymore. The guilt from this nasty break up resulted in Q and U becoming co-dependant, with U as the enabler. In the mean time, C has lost its own personality and is the doppelganger of S and K. C only asserts its personality when it's with H.<br> <dd>    Unfortunately this C-H relationship is a lot less stable than the Q-U. I mean, C and H really get around. H is into coupling. When W and H are together you get a whore. Who doesn't H fuck? C, S, T, sometimes even G and R! and SCH often make a kinky threesome.<br>   <dd>   Y is a hermaphrodite and because of its ambiguity of identity, Y has developed a serious case of self-loathing. Even when Y is forced to work within groups, it tends to stay at one end of the word party or another, rarely visiting the center of the group where it would find itself surrounded on all sides. P also has low self esteem, and is constantly concerned with what other letters think. P is yet another one of H's partners, and the sound of their climax is "F".<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images9/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    J and G are the most neurotic of the letters. After years goading and jesting, J's personality split and G was the result. Every now and then G will try and take J out for a drink and they get all confused. After all, who's buying?<br> <dd>    Z and S are brothers. Z, being the older of the two, was sent to military school because his parents had enough money at the time. S ended up in a liberal arts school studying sculpture and thus became more refined in form. Z ended up straight edged, and harsh, without the slippery sounds that S was able to conjure with his exquisite art.<br>  <dd>   E is a complex letter. It is retiring because it is often silent, polite because it lets I before it, and a social butterfly, showing up everywhere, as does S. All the other letters like E, but find S too cocky because he knows damn well that there would only be one of everything without it.<br>  <dd>    X, on the other hand is the polar opposite of T, who has never been able to get the cross out of it. Amusingly enough, X is an atheist and has a tendency to be found on soap boxes saying things that are not allowed. X was infuriated when mankind decided to make it the symbol for Jesus when He decided to come stomping his little Jesus-shoes on this  fine earth. It enjoys the irony that it is an atheist and the symbol for one of the most popular religious icons of the Western world.<br><center><IMG align =center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol4/images9/1.4.gif"><br></center> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> How do we know this?
