Dymphna was the daughter of an Irish Chieftain, Damon. When his wife died, Damon grieved heavily for her and searched in vain for another bride as fair. Around this time he began to notice the likeness of his dearly departed in his blossoming teenage daughter. He made his desires known to Dymphna, upon which time she fled with her chaplain, St. Gerebern, to Belgium. The Chieftain's men managed to track down the fugitives and revealed their location (the woods near Geel) to Damon. Damon sailed from Ireland, surprised our saint, and demanded she return with him and accede to his demands. Dymphna refused fervently, knowing such carnal incestuous  relations were absolutely forbidden by the Church. With this refusal the maddened father drew his sword and slew his daughter. St. Dymphna was buried in the woods near the shack in which she was martyred. Soon after her death miracles began occurring at her grave. Epileptics and the insane were especially drawn to the site, and an asylum was constructed there in the 13th century. The asylum still stands today (with improved and modernized care) and is dedicated to our saint. St. Dymphna is, understandably, the patron of lunatics.<br>	<dd>Other martyrs of note this week include <B>St. Matthias</B> (<B>May 14</B> (chosen to replace Judas as one of The Twelve, Matthias was captured and blinded by cannibals on a mission to Ethiopia. He was rescued by St. Andrew, but met his death of martyred bliss with an ax near the Caspian Sea.)) and <B>St. Hallvard</B> (<B>May 15</B> (A Norwegian prince who was struck down by a shower of arrows when he attempted to help a falsely accused slave woman.) <br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume4/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
