And well.... It came, it went. I am... and I suppose I'm back for a little more. So I guess I've had what some would consider a stay of execution for the time being.<br>  <dd>   Last year it seemed as if every family member or complete stranger (not too much difference if you ask me) who found out that... This Was It! The Big Year! The year I finally removed my head from the emergency airplane crash position and dealt with real time, real people, and most importantly the Real World&#153;.<br>   <dd>  These friends would pass on their pearls of wisdom from their own high chairs of experience telling me that soon, ah yes very soon life would become less worth living. Life would become more difficult. Anyone out there who thought life was rough enough already, just wait until you're older. That's when all the misfortune of the universe piles it's shit on your shoulders, or at the very least that's what your elders and (ahem) betters tell you. You have to sit there quietly listening to this drivel, because if you say anything and you're a girl at least, then you're being sassy. While you listen to the doomsday droning you know you can take a fair amount of pleasure from the fact that the person giving this fine oration is a firm believer in the great traffic light conspiracy  and that the reason they act like the world is out to get them is because it is in fact true.<br>   <dd>  People always link youth with idealism as if it's one of those things that begin to disappear with the steady degradation of the telomeres. Your hair turns white, starts to fall out, your skin looses elasticity, and, oh yeah, you become a crotchety old bastard; it's all part of the aging process.<br> <dd>    So you widdle away your time while they'd speak about the Real World&#153; as if suddenly, without warning, as soon as your diploma is placed in your hand, you match grins with the fake looking man in front of you, and smile pretty for the camera, you find yourself standing on a pumpkin in the middle of a Illinois wearing only your underwear, suspiciously watching mice scurry underfoot. Then you slap your palm to the side of your fore head exclaiming, "Shit! What time is it?"<br>   <dd>   The Real World&#153;.<br>   <dd>  Where the hell have I been these past twenty two years? And you can stop waving those red shoes in front of my face, I know it wasn't Kansas. I wish adults would give us a little more credit; the last time I was stupid enough to believe that everyone had my best interests at heart was age five. Let me tell you, kindergarten hardened me real fast.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/dim.html"> Other Universe Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
