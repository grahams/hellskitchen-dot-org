Though I am by no stretch of the imagination a theosophist, this column is dedicated to Faerie, it's innumerable denziens, and anything associated with them.<br>   <dd>  I had planned on jumping right in and talking about my personal favorite Faerie tribe, the Tuaha De Dannon, by I realized that I should define some of the terms I'll be using. Mainly: "Faerie."<br>  <dd>   The word "faerie" comes from the Indo-Europen root word for the latin "fatum" which means "fate." All the Romance languages share similar spellings this general name for the beings (fee, fada, fae, fata, fas...). Although it is recognized that there are many differentt "species" of faerie, the general terms for them is staggering. Interestingly enough, many of the names describe them in a ambivilient way, as though to stay their wrath or placiate them.<br>   <dd>   In the coming weeks, I'll be using "Faerie" as both a description of the shadowland these creature inhabit, as well as the inhabitants themselves. Just as "magic" refers to illusion while "magick" is the power to create, "vampires" are the things in movies and "vampyres" are those people who you run into every now and then, "fairy" will be used when talking about Disney-esk faeries: cute, whimsical, and entertaining. In short, nearly absent from faerie folklore. Besides, with the homosexual community's adoption of the word, it can lead to confusion.<br> <dd>    Next week...the nature of the land of Faerie.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
