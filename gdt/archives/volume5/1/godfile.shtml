I wouldn't say I've seen a lot of Jews since moving in,  but I don't feel self-conscious about playing my CD of Yiddish Folk Songs, if you get my drift.<br>   <dd>  And under the constant barrage of Jewishness, I come to the decision that I like the Jews. Sure, I've known individuals Jews who I like a great deal, by I mean the whole group. It just struck me what an amazingly moral, ethical group of people they are.<br> <dd>    Maybe they really are God's chosen people. That would help explain all the shit they have had to put up with. God has been thinning them out. Making them stronger, purer. Sort of a divine eugenics plan.<br>  <dd>   First they leave Babylon so they can be enslaved by the Egyptians. Then get out from under the Egyptian thumb, wander in the sand for a while,  and eventually obliterate a few tribes living where they decided their Holy Land was. Unfortunately, their land of milk and honey was a sort of "Conquering Army Throughway." Living there must have been like having a sleepover with the guy who thinks the height of humor is to holler "STEAMROLLER!" at 2am, and then proceeds to show you just how fun it is. Then of course there was the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and all the shitty things they have to put up with on a daily basis.<br>   <dd>  But through it all, they have kept their word. They observe the rules given the them by Yhwy. Why? Certainly not to achieve heaven. They're not even sure if there is a heaven. No. Christians are the ones who dare walk up to their God and say, "Ok. You say you want me to do these things...by what's in it for me?" Christians are like children who take out the trash only after they have been told they won't get their allowance if they don't.<br>  <dd>   They do what was asked of them, not for a reward or to avoid some fiery punishment, but because their God told them to. Who were they to say no? He is their God.<br>   <dd>  If you were to meet your Creator, and see his infinitely Sadness, could you deny Him?<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/godfile.html"> Other God Files in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
