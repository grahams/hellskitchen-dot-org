Siskle  rants. Ebert raves. GDT says: "Give me a fuck'n break!"<br>   <dd>   Disney, though producing technically incredible movies, is evil pure and simple.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#135;</A></a> This is not to say that I wish to see Disney dismembered and done away with; I mean, everyone needs to have their antagonist.... After all, they're good at what they do, but what they do is absolutely horrible. Like any child, I enjoyed watching Disney films; even their live action stuff (especially "Escape From Witch Mountain"). It wasn't until I watched Disney's "Peter Pan" that I began to become disillusioned. I knew the story from my childhood, and that cartoon was not the story. They corrupted it. It made me feel dirty  just to watch it. And  "Pinocchio"  was a joke. I mean, in the story, Jimminy was crushed by wooden boy when pine for brains didn't want to hear what his conscience was saying.  But  what put me over the edge, what really made me recognize that the Disney Corp. was a tool of evil<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> was when I watched Disney's "The Little Mermaid." Before I can express the true scope of my indignation, let me tell you a story:<br>  <dd>    As a very young child, when I wasn't building castles in the moonlight or watching tele-evangelists at 4 am, I would sometimes catch a cartoon that would begin with a narrator  taking about a story told in Amsterdam. It would show the statue of the Little Mermaid, and the cartoon would begin. That movie was one of the greatest influences upon me. Later, once I was old enough to begin my raiding parties against the local libraries, looting and pillaging along the way, I read the Little Mermaid and the cartoon I had seen was wonderfully accurate; the Little Mermaid even killed herself in the end, rather than slay the one she loved. I remember crying a great deal over that....<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a><br> <dD>   Imagine my dismay when ads began showing up promoting Disney's "The Little Mermaid." Needless to say, I went and watched their diminutive puella piscosus .<br>       <dd> And she lived.<br>  <dd>     And she got married.<br>    <dd>  And I'm sure she lived happily ever after.<br>     <dd>  And after being the well spring of four kids and a sea horse she probably didn't even have to live out the rest of her life with saggy breasts, stretch marks, and a bad temperament.<br>   <dd>   My point is, Disney takes these wonderful stories that are filled with angst, despair, but not lacking in the hope of redemption, and They&#153; make them hyperglycemic. Now They&#153; take a story that, when I think of it, all I see is Quasimodo in the black and white movie shouting "Sanctuary! Sanctuary!"<br><dd>     What gives? I think Disney was just looking for an excuse to do a cartoon with a cripple. There is definitely a pattern to Disney's movies over the past few years. "Aladdin," "The Lion King," " Pocohontas,"  and now "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." An Arab, African, Native American, and a cripple (honestly, there was some hope for the future with "The Lion King".  At least they ripped off Hamlet with a little bit of originality, kind of like what Bernstein and Sondheim did to "Romeo and Juliet").  When you get right down to it though, Disney could have saved a lot of time and trouble over the past few years if they just did Richard II (and since Shakespeare is dead and gone, they wouldn't  even have to pay royalties).<br> <IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Disney's next great cinematic masterpiece will be staring a short, blind, Asian homosexual midget with a goiter and lisp. Maybe the story of Confucius Keller the Great. It could happen.<br>     <dd> Actually, if Disney can take great things and make them horrible, maybe it works the other way: they could take horrible things and make them great. Just image: Disney's "The Little Fuhrer."<br>    <dd>  Watch spellbound as Disney's newest triumph tells the story a poor Jewish painter who rose to power and was loved by millions.  Can't you just see the opening scene:  Camera pans into a picturesque Bavarian village where hearty peasants roam and plump Hansel-and-Gretelish kids play.  Foreground:  the town square, complete with cobblestones; background:  forest, black (of course).  Music swirls:<br><A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4"><IMG  width=500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images1/song.gif"></A></a><br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   Including such lovable characters as David the Draydle, and Peter the Paintbrush, Disney's "The Little Fuhrer" features seven new songs specially composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, including the duet "Ich habe einem Vogel und das Welt wird mein Freund sein"  sung with his invisible friend, Klaus Crow, in his secret bunker. Cheer as the hero dupes his foes and lives happily ever after in a small town in Argentina after being helped by his friend Anke the U-boat. Get wrapped up in the magic and wonder that is Disney.<br>   <dd>   Maybe I'm overly critical. Then again, I don't think a story where a whole city ends up celebrating a hunchback is realistic. Beating him senseless and covering him with yogurt maybe, but definitely not celebrating.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#135;</A> This does not mean that I agree with the all the religious groups protesting Disney. Saying that Disney promotes homosexuality is no reason to ban them. Hell if Disney is promoting non-traditional lifestyles in their theme parks, bravo to them! I would have been a lot happier if the religious groups were protesting against Disney based on how they have slaughtered fairy tales over the years.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164;</A> Someday soon when the threads of reality are wearing a bit thin and could do with a damn good darning, somewhere in the locality of a children's theatre the kids are finally going to get a good look at Thumper and the Dungeon Dimensions from whence he came. Yeah, you can call him Flower if you want to, but don't expect me to.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#165;</A> If anyone else remembers seeing this movie and knows the name, please let me know. I'd love to find that movie once again. <BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#134;</A> Sung to the tune of "Tonight" <BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
