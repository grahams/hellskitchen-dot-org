Join with me in the delight that is dogma: the pantheon of Catholic saints.<br>    <dd>  The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>September 8-14 </B>is <B>St. Adrian</B> (<B>Sept 8</B>). Adrian was a pagan prison-guard at Nicodemia in the 4th century, and was himself thrown in prison for sympathizing with his Xian captives. He and his fellow prisoners were tended by his wife (St Natalia) who shaved her head and disguised herself as a man to gain access to them in prison. During the torture process (all medieval prison guards were required to take two semesters of torture materials and processes in college) our saint's legs were cut off.<br>   <dd>   This delighted his wife who prayed for him to have his arms, or at least his hands, cut off as well- such extremes were fitting for a true martyr. Her wish wasn't to be fulfilled; Adrian and the others were burned at the stake. Supposedly a "miraculous" rainstorm vanquished the flames before our saint's body was completely consumed and Natalia was able to escape the scene with one of his hands...what luck! (Maybe it's just me, but wouldn't the rainstorm have been more "miraculous" of it had put out the inferno before everyone died instead of it simply making it easier for an eager widow to abscond with a relic? I think I'm just jaded...)<br><dd>    Other Saints of note this week include: <B>St. Nicholas of Tolentino</B> (<B>Sept 10</B>). A monk who during his life worked among the poor and tried to bring peace to the rival factions inhabiting the city of Tolentino, St. Nicholas was once beaten with a stick by the Devil (they used to have it on display in his church) and was visited by the Blessed V irgin, St Augustine and St Monica when he was sick (they of course cured him (with wet bread), even though they had been dead for centuries themselves). What makes him eligible for inclusion here (besides the nasty stick-beating incident) revolves around not his life, but his corpse.<br>  <dd>    Forty years after his death a German monk, feeling that his homeland needed more relics, broke into St. Nicholas' tomb and chopped off our saint's arms. He (the robbing German, not our saint) ran off, dare I say, like a thief in the night, but, to his astonishment, found himself at the tomb the next morning, arms in hand-running in place! Since that incident the arms are said to bleed whenever misfortune befalls the church.<br> <dd>     Other Martyrs this week are <B>St Theodard</B> (<B>Sept 9</B>): killed with a hatchet by bandits and <B>Protus</B> and <B>Hyacinth</B> (<B>Sept 11</B>): two eunuchs killed in Rome for converting some of the noble class.<br>  <dd>  Until next week "Do not wish to be anything but what you are, and try to be that perfectly."<br>					<dd>		-<I>St Francis de Sales</I><br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
