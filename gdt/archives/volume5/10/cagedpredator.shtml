Besides, no one likes a backseat driver. With all the ecological movements washing across the country, like toluene from a parafilm covered test tube, maybe we should relearn the lessons of the plains Indians:  when presented with a steaming carcass, we, too, should fashion integumentary handbags, femur flutes, and ropes of braided intestine.  Not to mention skin coats and lucky foot-charms. An extra layer of skin from someone's hands that are bigger than yours make great pot-holders, a clavicle is an adequate paperweight and conversation piece, but not much of real value can be gleaned from a rotten corpse.<br>   <dd>   The last industrial-scale program along these lines was spear-headed by the Nazi Corp. in the early 1940's. With an exploding...um, Uber-population, space was at a premium. Graveyards were taking up much- needed space, and in lieu of burying people standing up, there's little that can be done to help free up space except to make the people smaller or not bury them at all.  Making people smaller is the idea behind cremation (ashes take up very little space), but what a waste of energy!<br>    <dd>  The Nazis did their best to find uses for their surplus material. Signs all over Germany read : Clean Jews needed. Rumor has it that Walt Disney actually used exported Jews and Gypsies to help fill in the swampland that  became Walt's World of Wacky Wonder.<br>    <dd>  The end of World War II saw the end of the Nazi's program, as well as the problem. Ironically, Hitler's Final solution really did work: The number of Europe's eligible bachelors was in the parts-per-million-range, freeing up more land for the buffalo to roam. Now, the United States of America, third world countries that have water, and Asia in general are literally up to their bellybuttons in surplus humans. Options such as provoking war between India and China a la a Zimmerman telegram ploy are attractive, but in the end leaves a big mess and a nasty glow. Despite the numerous attempts at utilizing deceased humans as doorstops, lamp shades, and cannon fodder (or ammunition<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a>), we still manage to bury most of the ones we don't put through our Roto-Tiller.<br>  <dd>    After centuries of development, the Ahrryp & Noilacued Corp. (a subsidiary of Hell Inc. (the same people who brought you Ethiopian Flypaper Boys, Lemme-pigs, and the Big Bang)) is proud to bring you a solution to all your problems. Look out DeBeers, here comes Corpus Crystal. Not cubic zirconium, but just as disturbing, you can now take a deceased love one or, hell, live ones (much more fun and better sound effects), and squish the be-jesus out of them to make precious jems.<br>    <dd>  While it may be true that a dead-beat dad didn't contribute much to your life while he was alive, he's worth a lot to you dead. Could you imagine his unbelievable girth turned into a precious stone that could be sold at millions of times the value of the actual live scumball (and best of all, he no longer smells like cheap liquor. All the unprocessed alcohol in his system simply added more carbon and makes the facets really catch the light)!<br>   <dd>  Better than mood rings, Corpus Crystals really show you the kind of metal people are made of; more specifically, it shows you the carbon to trace element ratio. For a minimal cost Ahrryp & Noilacued will round up the extras in the drama (or cheap, badly written fiction) that is your life (the ones that just don't move the plot along at all and make you wonder why the author included them in the first place) and ship them to their Concentration Camps&#153;. There, these luckless wastes of space enjoy a short life of bliss rarely experienced this side of Valhalla.<br>   <dd>   Given a strict diet of carbohydrates, greens that have to be eaten at every meal, and forced to lounge about in great tents (well, it is a camp) high in carbon dioxide, their systems eventually are saturated in carbon.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> When the time comes to harvest them, the carbon dioxide is replaced with carbon monoxide, and they stupidly keep breathing until they pass out, having no idea they are being asphyxiated. Similar to a laboratory autoclave, but more like a salad shooter, the actual mechanisms used in the "worthless-stiff-to-precious-mineral-o-matic" are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that other elements in the body besides carbon give an entire range of precious gems: emeralds, rubies, sapphires. Diamonds can be made, but require some preliminary processing to remove the impurities. For additional cost, you can have people who screwed you over in life, were lousy lovers in bed, or had a tattoo that read "Gerald Ford Forever" converted into a rhinestone or perhaps those little plastic jewels that your mother would buy at the craft store. Ignoring the post-mortum retaliations, it will be easily evident to everyone that we're all bright, shiny, happy people holding hands on the inside. Even the people who are vicious and nasty on the outside. Maybe them especially....<br>   <dd>  This will, of course, will be the end of the line for those leaching, vulturous life insurance companies. After all, life insurance becomes meaningless when you can compress the body of the deceased and sell it for more than the value of the insurance award.  In fact, the estate of the departed might be transferred to the jewel's wearer,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a> from heir to heir, until megacorps share links on one financial bangle of power, worn around the neck of the CEO.<br>   <dd>   It's our sincere hope that this literary piece of fluff and fun will inspire people of all cultures to put away their zubaz pants, Rush Limbaugh fan club newsletters, and join us in the crusade for a better, shinier tomorrow.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> The whole controversy revolves around the planned establishment of a single monetary unit in the EC (Ethereal Community).
