I knew I could very easily bang off a "God File" (I have more vaguely theological thoughts than you know. Probably caused by a mild case of temporal lobe epilepsy). A little harder would have been to do a "Fey Denizen." I even took some of my reference books to work with me.<br>    <dd>  Then, as I went to look at our illustrations for this week, I received the news that our illustrator wasn't going to be able to do illustrations for us next quarter. Needless to saw, I was not pleased.<br> <dd>    Much of our front page material is done a few weeks a head of time (at least over breaks) to insure that when we hit a lull in our creativity (like I did this week), we'll still have something to print. Now we're in a bind and need your help.<br>  <dd>   Anyone who is interested becoming our new illustrator would have to be reliable, as we print every week of the academic year, whether there are pictures or not. Though there is no monetary payment, you get to hang out with the people who started the original satire publication on RIT. Plus, you'll have an "in" with a publication that we hope will grow very big, very soon.<br>   <dd>  If you're interested, drop us a line as soon as you can. We have material all ready to be illustrated.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
