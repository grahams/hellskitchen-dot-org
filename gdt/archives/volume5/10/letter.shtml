Is this two or three different things thrown together? Is the main title <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>, or is that just one section, why isnt it all just one collection, with different articles? it seems that hells kitchen and <I>Melancholy Predator </I>really look at themselves as different entities. Im not even sure what to call the publication as a whole, because i might offend those who are not part of that specific section that i unwittingly singled out. Please, if you have time, clear this up for me.  Thank you.<br><br></td></tr></table></center> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>   <dd> There has been more than the usual confusion about what Hell's Kitchen is, since the introduction of our new combined print format.  Hells Kitchen, as seen in print right now, is made up of constituent parts that include <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>, <I>Melancholy Predator</I>, <I>Cereal</I>, and <I>The Iconoclast</I>. Each of these names represents a discrete group of people producing a distinct publication.<br>  <dd>    Hell's Kitchen is not, despite its contiguous-paper appearance, a single publication.  Hell's Kitchen is a rapidly expanding federation of like-minded groups of students and alumni that want to express themselves in print and on the web.  The primary purpose of Hell's Kitchen, in its role as a purveyor of information, is to expose ideas to a reading public clearly and interestingly.  This task is completed by the individual publications within Hell's Kitchen in a variety of ways including poetry, illustrations, satire, prose, news, critiques, maps, diagrams, and even mail-in campaigns.  Each separate publication group defines its own schedule, its own style, its own rules, but they each group agrees to become part of the larger coalition known as Hell's Kitchen.<br>   <dd>   Hell's Kitchen is currently composed of four extant publications, three produced on the RIT and U of R campuses and one produced in Rutgers, NJ.  Hells Kitchen also includes two dormant publications, at least one of which is to become animate into life in only a few weeks.<br>   <dd>   So in other words, if you're not sure what to call the chunk of paper you hold in your hand, feel free to call it Hell's Kitchen, no one will mind; in fact, it's a point of pride among most of members to be associated with this group.  You should also know, however, that each group has its own ideosycrancies, pet peeves, identity that it is built on.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
