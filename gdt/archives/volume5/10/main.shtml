Yeah, it was way cool in the 2nd grade to have one of those Izod cuties stuck on your shirt. Maybe even a Bad Dog tee. Then came the time that Levi's became mandatory to use the slide, and you couldn't play basketball unless you had Nikes on.<br><IMG width = 100 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images10/1.1.gif"><br>  <dd>    And now?<br>    <dd>  Now Coca-Cola sells home products (magnets, calendars, suitable-for-framing-pictures, tampons in their trademark bottle shape (just pop it in and wait for the toxic shock syndrome to set in)), as if people actually want to live surrounded by memorabilia of the good old days...when people also drank Coke. Then again, when mainland China and the United States of America first opened trade relations in the 1970's, the first thing they asked for was "bite the wax tadpole."<br>  <dd>    A big thank you has to go out to Norman Rockwell for helping us celebrate Christmas by depicting jolly old Santa Nick slugging down his favorite soft drink.  Like Santa'd make it around the world in that sleigh after a Coke binge. No wonder he's willing to squeeze his way down all those chimneys, he has to keep running to the bathroom. Too bad the old man's so addicted to caffeine.  My Dad always used to leave Jim Beam for Santa.  Somehow that was more comforting to me and my Dad....<br>  <IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images10/1.2.gif"><br>     <dd> Ted Turner has done more corporate evil than even Fox. Next year, after their satanic union, the Turner-Fox Network will deflower the first day of the new year with the Hitachi-Blockbuster-Home Depot Cotton Bowl.<br><dd>   At some point, the concept of supply and demand got twisted around. The market is no longer driven by the needs of the consumer. Companies don't pay attention to what people think they want; they make a product and then create a need for it.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Home shopping networks will gladly create a need in you for products ranging from acetelyne torches to zinc oxide at such phenomenally low prices that you can't help but rack up thousands of dollars in credit card debt, leaving you with interest payments far in excess of what you would have paid in cash at a local store.<br><IMG  width = 100 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images10/1.3.gif"><br>     <dd>  Visa and Mastercard, listen up: if you don't own these networks, you should.<br>    <dd>  The shell-shock that was the 1980's created an immunity to wearing every item of clothing possible (yes, even codpieces) festooned with Adidas and Nike logos. You just do it. Daily, we allow companies to invade our lives, and the companies know it.<br>   <dd>   In the future?<br>    <dd> Well, it will be the ultimate evolution of advertising! Truly personal ads. In the not-too-distant future, mega-conglomerates could hold sweepstakes to pick "lucky" individuals to be walking-talking-eating-"living" advertisements for their products. They could have this bright red Coca-Cola insignia emblazoned on their forehead,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a>  and tiny speakers by JVC implanted into their epidermis, expounding the virtues of TimeWarner.  Imagine after getting that new romantic interest out of their respective undergarments, discovering they have a nano-neon subdermal picture of the Republican Presidential candidate from 1984 winking back at you from their chest.  You could even have your sweat glands altered to always excrete  the newest perfume from Calvin Klein!<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images10/1.4.gif"><br><dd>     Not to worry. Celebrities will still turn their fame into advertising royalties.  It'd be perfect -- O.J. Simpson as Oriental Ginsuhands, and AIDS clinics handing out free syringes colorfully decked out in another wacky Bugs Bunny scenario supporting the latest health plan of choice from the AMA (They&#153;).<br>    </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Just look at the hoola hoop. Somebody just tell me there was a demand for that damn thing before it was invented. Today we've got the newest craze, one of those large colorful styrofoam things you can find in just about any store and you never see anyone buying. What the hell is that thing for anyway? If you really want to beat somebody with something, I can list a lot of things that would be more fun, if you can imagine all the giggles and guffas to be had with a really sturdy two-by-four with a couple of nails hammered into the end. Now that's a real child's toy. Cheap and easy assemblage, no batteries required.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A> Do not accept the mark of the beast.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
