Saliers</B><p>   <dd>  Welcome, brothers and sisters, to your own time of suffering--finals week. The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>November 10-16</B> is a little different this time around (no, I haven't lost weight or cut my hair in a tonsure again or anything as spectacle-ridden). There were many lesser-known martyrs crying out for recognition (or was that in pain?) this week, but I've decided to focus on one day in martyrology: <B>November 12</B>.<br>   <dd>   First we have <B>Saints Aurelius and Publius</B>. They were Bishops who wrote against the intellectual death that was the Montanist and Cata-Phryigian heresies in the 2nd century. I guess the opposition didn't care too much for the commentary and condemnation espoused by our saints and had them killed.<br>   <dd>   Next we have <B>St Benedict and his companion Saints John, Matthew, Isaac and Christinus</B>. They were missionaries to the Slavs who were massacred by thieves at their monastery near Gnessen (nowadays in the Czech Republic by my estimates).<br>     <dd>  Thirdly we have <B>St Paternus</B>, a French monk of the 8th century. He was murdered by a group of sinners he had attempted to counsel and reform.<br>   <dd>   Lastly we have <B>St Maxellendis</B>. Another of the proud line of Virgin Martyrs killed by an obsessed admirer due to her devotion to Christ and rejection of worldly relationships (You wondering where we get half of the TV movies made today? Simply replace the word "Christ" with "cheerleading" or "acting" or "horses" and "puppy-dogs" and "admirer" with "coworker" or "ex-husband" or "junkie boyfriend." Add anyone from the cast of a defunct sitcom (Judith Light, Alyssa Milano etc.) and voila! Cheese-o-rama).<br>    <dd>   During the upcoming break, don't forget to take time to remember <B>St Catherine of Alexandria</B> (<B>Nov 25</B>). She is the inspiration for the medieval torture wonder, "the Catherine Wheel,"which in turn was the inspiration for a great band from East Anglia.<br>    <dd>  Until next quarter, <I>sorority lint ban</I>.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
