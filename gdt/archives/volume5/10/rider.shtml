Their mother never accepted the fact that she had two children and thus had only afforded them one name. The male aspect of insecurity is quite buff and robust. Most existence is channeled into the narrow streamlining of the stereotypical male. The feminine Insecurity is basically everything feminine. She is flamboyant, yet complacent, a seductress, and yet clings to the vestial chastity belt to protect her believed purity. Insecurity tries to become their own particular gender roles so much they become caricatures of themselves in the attempt. With the same horse, same name, and same existence, they ride together for life, fearing ever to separate as if neither would have a name if the other were no longer by their side. And without their name, they are nothing.<br></td><td valign = top width=250><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images10/rider.gif"><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/rider.html">Other Rider Cards in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
