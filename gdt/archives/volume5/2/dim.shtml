I guess old habits die hard. It is actually a month from the day she died.<br>   <dd>  I often muse to myself over such times thinking about all those people who take such times to proclaim, "Ah, yeah. That guy/girl/acquaintance/pet/annoying waiter was the best." They&#153; remember back to all the good times, only the good times. I could try to do as They&#153; and open up the flood gates of fuzzy reminiscing, but for the life of me all I can think to say is that she was a bitch in the truest sense of the word (the pun was obvious, but exceedingly appropriate).<br>  <dd>   If she had been human she would have been a beautiful, bitchy blockhead with all of the trimmings: insatiable jealousy, a viscous temper, breath you could starch your clothing with, the need to dominate and become the center of attention for all situations, and the quite embarrassing habit of trying to kill any and all persons who tried to enter or exit our house through a particular portal. In other words, she was a pain in the ass.<br>  <dd>   Strangely enough, even neglecting the fact that she'd saved my life on more than one occasion simply by default (no matter what they do, large German shepherds seem to have that effect on people), I actually liked her. I think perhaps it might have been her unendearing qualities that I loved most; when she wouldn't listen to anything else and the only way to make her come running back were the words "Hey Stupid!", the way I taught her how to squeeze herself underneath the bed until all you could see was her nose protruding from beneath it, and the fact that every time we played hide and seek together she was daft enough to try to find me with her eyes instead of her extraordinary sense of smell, and blind enough not to be able to see a wall six inches in front of her face. I suppose that one of the reasons I love her the most is because she allowed me to draw a parallel between her whimper-and-kick-filled dreams and those of my father, not three feet away prone in front of the television in the same circumstance. My family said, "She's chasing rabbits." And now I say the same about my father whenever I see him.<br>   <dd>  She had a terrible personality and I loved her not despite it, but partly for it. What is so wrong with admitting that someone of the recently deceased population also happens to be jerk? There really should be more commemorative monuments out there that say, "Dad-What an asshole. God bless his bedeviled soul." Hell, every time someone proclaims that I'm evil I still turn a bright crimson. I guess the novelty never wears off on that statement.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/dim.html"> Other Universe Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
