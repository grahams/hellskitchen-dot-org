Tolkien<p></I> <dd>    The Land of Faerie has, in the minds of many, become a sort of lesser Heaven. Filled with wise, beautiful creatures, modern man yearns to be invited within. What is ignored time and time again is the close, perhaps essential link between our two worlds.<br>  <dd>    Though the inhabitants of Faerie most certainly determine how their realm appears, it is as though they lack imagination. Waterfalls, dark woods, breezy steppe, wild rides under a full moon- all these, and more, are within Faerie, but it is borrowed.<br>  <dd>   Even the faeries have patterned themselves after the creatures they find most interesting with our realm. Mainly, Man. Faerie lore is littered with tales of faeries being attracted to the artists, poets, and musicians of our tribe. He who can embellish upon the arts from Faerie is treated as a Lord by the revelers from that shadowy land.  It may not be a coincidence that many prodigies from our race have died young. Perhaps Mozart is still composing for those in Faerie.<br>   <dd>  While man excels in Creating, it is the faeries who are horribly beautiful. We complement each other well....<br>  <dd>   Unfortunately, Man's creative impulse has inadvertently led to his turning away from the Beauty which Faerie offers. Now, beauty is a slim, fine tuned machine, and the faeries languish in a land which diminishes as humans stop creating things of Faerie. All too soon, the last doorway to that shadowy land will close and our people will truly be alone.<br>   <dd>   Our world and that of Faerie is symbiotic. Without our Creativity, the Faeries may be trapped in eternal sameness and eventually fade to nothing, like a echo in the distance. Without their Beauty, man will damn himself to a world of asphalt and steel. Of efficiency and the God of the Clock.<p><B>Next week: some helpful hints on how to avoid faux pas when visiting Faerie.</B><br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
