I abhor entering malls and department stores. Of course this leads to the unfortunate situation where I put off shopping so long I must spend hours in the store just getting the basics to survive. You know: milk, toilet paper, the newest Terry Pratchett book, the usual.<br>  <dd>   When I'm shopping, I move like I'm in a race. There have been instances where the ultra-pure, air-conditioned atmosphere of a mall or shopping center, coupled with my quick walking, have dried my peepers out, leaving me sitting on the floor, rubbing my eyes and cursing.<br>    <dd>  It's not so bad when I have a group to shop with; we divvy up the list and get through the store in record time. It's a beautiful sight to see. The 4x100 relay team representing GDT zips through a store, leaving perplexed old ladies trying to determine why they're missing groceries and their false teeth are in backward.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>   "Pass the Baguette. Go! Go! Go!"<br>    <dd> Regardless of how quickly you can get everything you need, you eventually have to get into line. The lines are the great equalizers. Everyone young, old, speedy, ugly they all stand in lines that never move.<br>  <dd>   Now at this point, you're probably thinking that we are going to say something about the seven items or less isle and how idiots with two shopping carts mounded with nothing but "Alpo" pick these lines and insist that they have only one product. Well, you're wrong. That sort of thing has been beaten to death,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> and it really isn't as annoying as the fact that all lines move at the same speed. Actually, those "seven items or less" isles move slower than any other lane. I think it's because the cashiers of these particular circles of hell think to themselves, "Hey, this is the cheesy lane. No reason to work at normal speed. What's the rush?"<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images2/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   The really interesting thing is that you can get into line with only 3 others ahead of you, and once you reach the shelves, there's suddenly 5 people in front of you. A bit disconcerting, but perfectly logical. Allow me to elucidate:<dd> <dd>    At about the same time that laser scanners began to be installed in grocery stores around the country, another technological marvel was slipped in as well. Thanks to the same research that brought you Silly-Putty, stores now possess the ability to fold space in check-out lines. The up side is that the customer sees only five to seven people in any line at any given time when in reality there can be 20 people folded into their devious little Mal-mart Mobius strips; you can't see those cockled little buggers until you've reached the fold yourself, and by then, it's too late. <br><dd>  That's why isles have shelves on either side. Though functional, the shelves are nothing more than attractive walls keeping customers from exiting the folded space crosswise. In trial stores when the technology was first being developed, prospective customers that entered the lines in their 20's and then traveled sideways in the fold could exit white haired and toothless. There were even some that never exited.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> Tricky business, folding checkout lines. Sometimes, the whole system crashes, throwing customers as far as 20 feet into the stacks of Spiderman Toothpaste marked down 20% and causing minor earthquakes as the building suddenly expands to accommodate the new space.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images2/1.4.gif"><br>  <dd>   There are accidents of this kind all the time in southern California. The high temperatures simply overheat the complex systems involved. In Mexico, however, standards are lower and failures can level entire villas.<br> <dd>    Another bonus, brought to you by the minds at NAFTA.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A>Not that GDT is against a good beating. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164;</A>Recently NASA and the FDA sponsored an expedition into the folded space of various checkout lines to try and discover exactly what happened to the missing shoppers.
