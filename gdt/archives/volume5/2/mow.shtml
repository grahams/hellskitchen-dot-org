Januarius was the Bishop of Benevento in the early 4th century. During the Diocletian persecution he was thrown into a furnace and subjected to lions, neither of which harmed him. Like most other fire-proof, animal friendly saints before him, he had no such rapport with the steely blade that cleft his neck.<br>   <dd>   Some of the faithful collected his relics, which centuries later ended up in Naples. Among these relics were a few vials of blood that on occasion liquefy. This "boiling"of the blood occurs on various holy days throughout the year (except in times of oppression or strife) and has a great and loyal following to this day. If, during the ceremony, the blood is not being cooperative, a group of women known as the aunts of St Gennaro shout "Boil! Boil! Boil, damn you!" Who said going to church wasn't fun! Fittingly, St Januarius is the patron saint of blood banks.<br>   <dd>  Another saint of note this week is <B>St Robert Bellarmine</B> (<B>Sept 17</B>). As head of the Vatican Library he was one of those who disputed Galileo and his findings, eventually leading to the great astronomers run-in with the Grand Inquisition. Bellarmine wrote that to say the Earth revolved around the sun "is as erroneous as to claim that Jesus was not born of a Virgin." Well, if you're basing your argument on something as concrete as that then you have nothing to worry about...right?<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
