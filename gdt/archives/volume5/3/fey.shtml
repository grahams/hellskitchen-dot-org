And depending where you go, your comments and actions can end up offending quite a few people. In Maine, if you make fun of the Mormons, people think you're talking about a branch of the PTA, whereas in Utah, you could end up like the Fancher party.<br>   <dd>  Nevertheless, for all our differences, there are customs that bind us; that make us Americans. In a vaguer sense, the same can be said of humans in general. There is, for lack of a less used term, what could be called the human condition. The same can be said for those of Faerie.<br>  <dd>   Though the doors to Faerie are slowly disappearing, there are still some who manage to slip in, or, even rarer in these latter days, are invited behind the veil. If you should even find yourself being asked to join some young wraith for dinner so you can meet her Mum, here are some basic points to help you avoid looking like an ass, angering your guests, avoid killing yourself, and generally avoid faux pas.<br>  <dd>  <B> Faerie Food:</B> Don't eat it. Even if you think that it would be rude to refuse, you must. When Persephone ate the food offered to her by Hades, she was bound to that land. The same fate befalls all mortals; faerie food is pleasing to the sense, but is only glamour and has no substance. If one remains in Faerie and eats only faerie food, the body will be unable to return to our world. To complicate matters, time seems to pass differently in our two worlds. The course of a meal in their realm could be several weeks in ours. At best you may be malnourished upon leaving Faerie, at worst, you will die as soon as you leave.<br>  <dd>   <B>Dancing:</B> This is another no-no, and doesn't apply just to the land of Faerie. If you should happen upon a troop of dancing faeries, try your hardest to resist the urge to join. Their wild revelry can wear a mortal out to the point of exhaustion and death.<br>    <dd> <B>Gifts:</B> One of the more peculiar aspects of the sociable faeries is their inability to deny giving you what you want. They will give any object which they possess, but they demand a fair trade. Since few material objects can travel between our worlds, they normally take what they feel is a fair trade from the more etherical aspects of a person. This is undoubtedly connected to the Christian concept of "selling one's soul."<br>  <dd>   <B>Gratitude:</B> This is a tricky one. Faeries all seem to take offense to abundant displays of gratitude. In some cases, to repay the Wee Ones for their help only angers them and drives them away. All in all, it is best to acknowledge their help, either by leaving a minimal amount of food in a way that looks like it was forgotten (when dealing with the diminutive types), or silently accepting the help or hospitality of one of the more human like denizens, such as the Tuatha de Danan. Above all, show them respect.<br> <dd>  <B>  Next week: the morality of faeries.</B><br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG  width=500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
