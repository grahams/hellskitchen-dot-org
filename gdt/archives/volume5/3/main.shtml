Not just mind stealer, but reality warper. Somehow, they create a reality that is more real. How many times have you heard or thought, "Gosh, that's just like something in a movie." It's as though TV and movies are somehow more there and our lives pale in comparison. Take, for example, dandruff. Anyone in the western hemisphere must have some concept of what I'm referring to: those horrid commercials where "Chuck" is posing for the photographer and has huge hunks of his scalp on his shoulder. I mean the man should be faint from blood loss. And as if those quarter sized "flakes" weren't enough, the TV land magic circle hand swoops down to draw an ellipsoid around them and makes damn sure you see them in all their bestial wrath.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>  The circle hand. I guess the most important thing is the circle itself. It's snuggled right in there along with all the other special mass-media-punctuation-repair-kit bums; between the Underline Twins (Underline powers activate! Shape of a moving line, form of a curling spring) and Excessive Points of Exclamation (his friends call him "EPEs", pronounced "eaps").<br>   <dd>   Granted I realize none of you have the slightest idea of what I am talking about. Just walk with me a while.<br>  <dd>   Actually, march your hinder right to your mail box and pull out all the junk mail you've managed to accumulate over the past few days. Right there in your hands, in amongst the Exclusive Pin Numbers and Hidden Mystery Prizes is what I refer to.<br> <IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   To illustrate my point, which I have yet to make sparkling clear, think back to all the times you've read: "...You may already have won Ten Million Dollars...." Now just close your eyes and visualize those words. Let your mind rest easy for a while. Stop trying to see Ed McMahon in a thong. Ignore the impression that the words "Ten Million Dollars" are too much like a proper noun, and that in all actuality "Ten Million Dollars" is probably the name of some poor Spanish kid who stepped just a little too close to the edge of a white slavery ring. Let this slide out of your subconscious and away from your thoughts completely, damn it! No use in bringing up the past. Just relax. Calm yourself. Focus your entire attention on how you see the words. Are they written in red or blue in that personal-yet manufactured-handwritten text? Now look deeply and all will become revealed....<br>  <dd>   You've probably told yourself upon occasion that GDT could not possibly make an issue out of anything, and this one is here to prove you wrong. Yes, the issue at hand is the manner in which junkmail and its counterpart in the television medium tend to write, and most importantly, draw circles and their cohorts.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images3/1.4.gif"><br><dd>   Think about it. Right now, in your mind, superimpose every circle you have ever remembered from your mass media education and see what you get. It's the same circle.<br>   <dd>   Somewhere some guy is making millions of dollars because he just happens to be able to make the most casual, professional and yet legible print, underlines, circles, and exclamation points in the known world. Once he was a worker at a Mal-mart in the deep south...just punching away at his cash register. All that changed one day when an advertising executive came in to buy some extra golf pants. He went to the register where this unsuspecting boy punched away at his keyboard and slide scanner, and in one of those tedious, insignificant actions that can alter the future, the exec pays by Visa. As the boy pulls out the luckless exec's receipt, he quickly circles the amount of the charge and then writes that amount down, underlined twice, and ended with an exclamation point. As the exec turns to leave, he notices the sheer genius of the marks in front of him, strokes that would make a Japanese calligrapher die happy, and says, "Do that again!"<br>   <dd>  Anyway, it's just a scenario. They probably have try-outs for that sort of thing, where they try especially hard to weed out all of those people who dot their I's with hearts.<br>   <dd>   They take those freaks out back and sterilize them. Stops that particular madness right there.<br>  </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
