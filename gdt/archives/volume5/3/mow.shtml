We traipse again into the presence of the chosen ones, those dismembered do-gooder Catholic martyrs. The <B>Martyr of the Week</B> for <B>September 22-28</B> is <B>St Maurice</B> (<B>Sept 22</B>). Others of note this week are <B>St Phocas</B> (also <B>Sept 22</B>), <B>Cosmos</B> and <B>Damian</B> (<B>Sept 26</B>), <B>St Wenceslaus</B> (<B>Sept 26</B>).<br>      <dd>St Maurice was the commanding officer of the Theban legion, a part of Emperor Maximian's Roman Army made up of recruits from upper Egypt. The xian legion was part of a force that was to cross the alps and suppress an uprising in Gaul. While in Switzerland, on the eve of the battle, all were required to attend and/or perform public sacrifices to secure victory for the next day. This of course was sacrilegious and the legion refused, instead retreating to what is now St-Maurice-en-Valais. The Emperor ordered the decimation (the killing of every tenth man) until the soldiers would obey his orders. The devout men naturally chose martyrdom over pagan sacrifice, so all 6660 were executed. St Maurice's blood and ring, as well as the stone on which he was beheaded are preserved in the aforementioned Swiss city.  St Phocas (Sept 22 or July 23, depending on which calendar you subscribe to) was known for his hospitality to travellers. During the Diocletian persecution he gave shelter to some Roman soldiers whose mission was to execute our saint. During the night Phocas dug a grave in the garden. When morning came he confessed that he was the man after which they sought, was beheaded, and tossed into the ready pit.<br> <dd> Saints Cosmos and Damian (Sept 26) were travelling twin xian doctors who refused payment for their services. One arduous patient refused to let Damian leave her side without accepting 3 eggs as payment. Cosmos was so furious with his brother that he made it public knowledge that he wasn't to be buried with his twin. They, of course, were martyred (when the rocks and arrows hurled at them had no effect, the popular beheading was opted for) and prepared for burial separately. A lone camel persuaded the mourners, in the name of all cattle, to bury the brothers together (and no, I don't make this stuff up...).<br> <dd> St Wenceslaus was the Duke of Bohemia (Now parts of Slovakia and the Czech Republic) in 922 and attempted to bring xianity to his kingdom during a time of pagan reaction. He would hold feasts at which he would pressure the guests into saying the Our Father, savagely beating those who refused (Why, how very xian of you!). He allied himself with the German Empire (due to their xian King, Henry) which endeared him to very few in his homeland. He was eventually murdered at the door of a church by his brother, Boleslaus. The popular xmas song dedicated to him is pure fiction.<br> <dd> For those of you who are new readers and/or are xian conspiracy theorists, I replace the word christ in words in my writing with an "X" not to eliminate the mention of this great man (Kiss me, son of god!), but due to the fact that "X" is the symbol for Christ that comes down to us from the Romans. It simply makes typing this column easier. If you still have doubts, look up "X" in the dictionary and all will be revealed (the man speaks only truths!).<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
