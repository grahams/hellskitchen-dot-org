Well, now you can.<br>  <dd>   You don't have to page Bobby to find out where he is anymore. This is also your great opportunity to find yourself without the long-haired, barefooted, pot-smoking, peace-loving, fornicating life-styles usually wrapped up in such pursuits.<br>   <dd>  Thanks to Hell Inc. and the bargain basement prices that the republics of the old Soviet Union are selling secrets and military hardware for, GDT is proud to bring you the first Heisenberg Uncertainty map of the Rochester Institute of Technology.<br> <dd>    That's right. Since it is impossible for an observer to measure where anyone else is without altering their position and momentum, GDT utilized our newly-acquired, Soviet-built espionage satellite (if you think that's cool, you should see our submarine) in geosyncronous orbit over RIT and simple statistics to show you where any student is at any given moment. Yup. We know, more or less, where to find each and every one of you buggers and can drop you with a hi-impact lead, "Hello" whenever we want.<br> <dd>    Have a nice day.<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/vis.html">Other visuals in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> <br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size = +1><B>Created by:</B><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
