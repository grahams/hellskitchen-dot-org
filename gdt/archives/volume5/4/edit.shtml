On the radio, WBER (for our readers in various parts of the world, you can listen to WBER using RealAudio. The address is wber.monroe.edu), "the only station that matters," had just turned over its frequency modulated electromagnetic radiation to the "Raging Rhino's" game. There was a time when I would have simply hit a button on the preset station selection and slid smoothly over to The Nerve, but their programming is simply too annoying for me now. Better silence, or maybe NPR....<br>   <dd>  Ahead of me, a dilapidated station wagon shuddered to a stop at the light and my eyes caught a bumper sticker. I really didn't pay too much attention to what it said. All I saw were the call letters of a radio station. Without thinking too much about it, I turned the dial until the liquid crystal display read 99.7 (Sorry. I am nearly positive <I>this</I> jewel doesn't use RealAudio.) and prepared myself for whatever was going to issue forth.<br>  <dd>   I could have waited at that light for eons, watching the sun burn out and not be prepared. I had unwittingly turned to a Christian propaganda station.<br>  <dd>   (Before the few members of the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship (RIT chapter) quickly leave, you guys might want to stay. This editorial is partly directed to you. And, heck, if you know a member of the God group, please consider reading this to them.)<br>  <dd>   As luck would have it, the nasal-voiced speaker coming through my radio was taking part in a mock Q&A concerning the upcoming election and how different politicians stood with regards to topics presumably important to a Christian Soldier. So already I'm getting worked up. Fucking Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition. Fucking book-banning, prayer-forcing, intolerant jackals. I'm getting ahead of myself, though.<br>   <dd>  Like I said: I'm sitting there slowly winding up and somehow (I really wasn't paying too much attention, what with all my muttering) the foe questioner turns the topic to Creationism. <I>This</I> had my full attention, it being such a major campaign plank this year and all. Let's face it: no where else in the Western world is Creationism still an issue. I'm sure even the Pope doesn't give Creationism anything other than lip service. Hmmm, it took until the 1980's for the Vatican to formally apologize and say they were wrong for accusing Galileo of heresy, though.<br>   <dd>  Then, the magic moment: I hear that Pat Buchanan doesn't think he's descended from animals. The voice continues to drone on about how Evolution demeans the human condition and that Pugnacious Pat's views were encouraging, but I hear no more. I have to pull over. I can't see the road very well through the tears and I'm shaking bad enough to be a threat to myself and others.<br>   <dd>   No. I was not touched by the hand of God and no, I am not born again. Quite to the contrary.<br> <dd>    Purifying RAGE. That Goddam Nazi Pat Buchanan has come to represent, at least in my mind, the amassing darkness. A dark political spectre using words deemed holy to proselytize hate. Bastards! How dare you take a message of forgiveness and turn it into a weapon to cripple the minds and souls of people! Do you think this is what your prophet would have wanted?<br>  <dd>   (My hands shake while I write this. Time for a break, then I'll bring it all home for you.)<p>  <dd>   A friend and regular reader of GDT/Hell's Kitchen commented that she was talking to a guy from the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, and he was shocked that she read our material. He maintained that we are always taking pot shots at them.<br>   <dd>  Well, I went back through all the old issues and I found a total of three references to that illustrious group. Three references in nearly 60 issues. Not even full sentences. Clauses. Afterthoughts. Obviously this has to change.... Thanks for pointing that out, guy.<br>   <dd>  Yeah, GDT has lost its edge. We've become silly and whimsical (except for maybe "Jews" (Volume 4, Issue 10). We were so underwhelmed by the amount of mail from that one, that I had to make a separate folder so I couldn't  put them (the letters, not the Jews, silly) in it.<br>   <dd>  Next week...I stop being polite.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
