Mainly, what to do with the faeries. They simply did not fit into Christian cosmology. The founders of the Church had found ways very early on to deal with foreign gods: worship of pagan gods got you killed. As a reward, once people stopped worshiping the deities, the martyrs and saints were used to fill their vacume.<br>    <dd>  Faeries, however, represented a serious problem. Clearly not false gods, humans, or even angels, a category had to be found for them. This is the same problem Mohammed faced when his teachings started to spread.  For him and his followers, the faeries became jinn. For Christians, faeries were linked to Lucifer and his demonic host.<br>   <dd>  Stories of incubi and succubi are probably the Christianized stories of faeries choosing human mates. Even the innumerable stories of saints being tempted by demons are probably encounters with faeries. Story after story recounts how a saint is approached by a stranger who offers to help plow a field/dig a well/clean a home. When the saint accepts, the job is done faster than any mortal could. Of course the saint would denounce them as a demon, and the faerie would be offended  and leave.<br>   <dd>   There is even some question as to the spiritual nature of faeries. Thanks to Christian intervention, it is thought that faeries have no soul. This sentiment can be found immortalized in the story of the Little Mermaid; her self-sacrifice was even more poignant because upon her death, she would become nothing but foam on the sea.<br>  <dd>   The missionaries did make an accurate observation, regardless of their actions: No matter how human-like a faerie may appear, they are not human and are not bound by the same moral codes we use. While they demand respect from mortals, they are stereotyped as pranksters and even causing physical harm...sometimes death. Fickle as the weather, it is as though they know what a human should do, but can't quite figure out our motivations and thus never complete the illusion.<p><font size=-1><dd>For the past four weeks, I've tried to introduce you to some basic ideas connected with faeries, but I'll be taking a break from writing while I search for an illustrator. I'd like to start talking about particular faeries and it would help to have some art work to go with them. If you're interested in helping out, or if there is a faerie related topic you'd like to see discussed here, drop me a line care of GDT or talk to me directly c/o: sth8884@ritvax.rit.edu</font size><br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
