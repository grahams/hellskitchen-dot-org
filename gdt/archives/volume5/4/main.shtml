Yes, it's true: I come from a persuasion of feminine persons with identically miniscule quantities of extraneous fatty deposits at or around the general area of the torso. No, I'm not talking about shoulder pads. In more common vernacular, I merely stated that I come from a family of small breasted-women.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Unlike others who may find themselves stranded upon the same vantage point, I quite like the view.<br>  <dd>  I can assure you that the idea of increasing my own ability to produce caulking out of my nipples ("...one side gazpacho soup, the other free running, chilled champagne") has never tantalized my thoughts, no matter how many studies Dow Corning can produce to assure others that there is a higher incident rate of breast disfunction and a lower probability of breast cancer when one outfits themselves with gelatinous chest bumpers.<br><dd>  I mean, why would I ever desire implants when small breasts have so many perks (no pun intended)? Ever since the hormonally-induced tectonics of the region first squeezed the various substrata of skin and fatty tissue above the Great Breadbasket that was my chest, I have never truly had to deal with any of the adverse health defects that large, or even medium sized, breasts can induce, such as:<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images4/1.2.gif"><br> <UL><LI>Back pain<LI>Tearing of the connective tissue just above the chest<LI>That strange effect of attracting every skanky male (or female) within a fifty-mile radius<li>That peculiar affectation of many acquaintances to transfix their gazes in excess of one foot below eye contact. </UL><br><dd>    One more benefit to this little package deal is the fact that breast exams are a breeze; any irregular lump that is not a rib is almost certainly cancerous.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images4/1.3.gif"><br>  <dd> Many women resent the physical signs of aging, especially in regard to their antibody relocation and distribution conduits<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> which seem to gain momentum the further they fall towards the floor. Of course with the ebb and swell of time, all things must in turn decline...well almost all things. Forsooth, it's difficult to imagine the occurrence of sagging in certain body parts when you've<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> discovered, oftentimes much to your chagrin, that more impressive cleavage can be produced on your own disdainful forehead. The indifferent fact for the underdeveloped women of my family is gravity seems too've<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> completely passed us by (believe me, wearing those lead weights in the cuffs of your pants all the time can get downright aggravating sometimes). If it weren't for the occasional childbearings, our bosoms would have no place to go at all.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a> Sometimes I wonder if gravity didn't just take one look at the pitiful little stack on my chest, throw back its anthropomorphic head in fits of tumultuous laughter and say, "You want me to do what with that? Oh, no dear! I'm sorry. You've got the wrong inescapable physical law of nature. I can't work miracles."<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images4/1.4.gif"><br><dd>   They&#153; say that there is more bounce to the ounce, and from where I'm standing one thirty-two cent stamp ought to cover me. Even though it's true that all things will eventually come to rest about your knees, except for your ankles which will drag on the floor behind you, I can't help feeling that maybe I have been blessed by the burden of perpetual perk...even if I garb my nature in sarcasm.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> And large breasted men.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A> Can't figure it out?
