This life form is vaguely humanoid in shape, with all the appropriate vestigial limbs. They literally appear out of thin air in a particular spot, somewhere near Dayton, Ohio, whenever another unique "good intention" is preformed in the world around us. Upon entering the world they fall to the ground, where they land on the very first Gud'n Tenshun of them all and then they proceed to run down the path that has been created by all of the subsequent Gud'n Tenshuns. Each new Gud'n Tenshun adds another stone onto this path that cuts its way through the landscape.<br>    <dd>  When Gud'n Tenshuns are still young, they have a more rounded appearance, which quickly begins to flatten out due to their initial soft silicon shell state.  If you walk on them while they are still relatively young, you can amuse yourself by watching as you start smushing their faces and other body parts. The Gud'n Tenshuns fit themselves together in this road much like people packed in sardine cans, still people-shaped, but also vaguely warped to fit around the person next to them.<br>   <dd>  It is interesting to note that as you walk on the Gud'n Tenshuns, they never emit cries of pain; they merely quote from Life's Little Instruction Book, mumbling such things as: "Remain open, flexible, curious," or "Surprise a new neighbor with one of your favorite homemade dishes - and include the recipe."<br>   <dd>  There is an old saying that says, "the road to Hell is paved with Good Intentions,"  This is somewhat misleading. In all actuality the road that Gud'n Tenshuns make is very random in its wanderings, and it is continually growing. The road to Hell is paved with Gud'n Tenshuns, which has nothing to do with Gud'n Tenshuns' intentions, but the fact that Hell itself is the one moving around to always be in front of this road.<br></multicol></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><center><table border><tr><td valign = top width=250><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images4/rider.gif"><br></td></tr></table></center> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/rider.html">Other Rider Cards in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
