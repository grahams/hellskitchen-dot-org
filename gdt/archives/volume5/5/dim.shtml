You have been warned....</font size><p>    <dd> I suppose my greatest grievance with the world about is continuity; the truth between life and literature, or I suppose life and any part of what we consider society. Almost all things can be reduced to the story: history, goals, needs, any pop culture iconography, religion and all. It all boils down to a story. Everyday people sit down and attempt to write their stories, but life can never be too close to the real thing. Real life can never compare to the fraud of the story and what it has done to the people we all are. I know I'm being elusive, it seems I usually am, but read on, I promise to elucidate my musings.<br>  <dd>   I was spoon-fed all the fairy tales, television, movies old and new, the bible, and history, and I incorporated what was behind it all into myself. It is the make-up of a story that concerns me, all of its parts from the lofty lies of childhood fairy tales to dusted on truth of history, it all comes across in the same manner. A slowly-starting background and plot, building tensions towards a summit, after the climax an expedient resolution of various plot points, and finally denouement. Cut, end of story. You fold over the back cover of the book and everything is closed, until perhaps there is a sequel or World War I (Part II). The problem is that the idea of a story and all of its parts have infiltrated ordinary life so completely that each person is continually trying to weave that special story about themselves, but the problem is that the pieces so integral to the basis of a story can find no reflection of truth within the reality of our world.<br>  <dd>   Each day I find myself writing a story that is not mine and each night I discard the paper as empty. No matter how much plot, climax, and resolution can be found in any person's life, it can only upon occasion realize denouement and completion. No matter how many times a day, week, or year, the story cycle runs through your system it is hardly ever completed. This is partly why many of today's icons are people who, either by accident or intention, found denouement. A completion to the story before it went to far: Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Elvis Presley, and of course. even Jesus.<br>    <dd>  In the end, a story is just another way of bringing order into chaos, what man does best. Every human needs to have a plot, a reason, because once you pull the rug out from under them, they no longer have any idea what they're standing on. Religion is just a backdrop of a story older and greater than man, but about man. Every human needs a mission, goal, desire, or need; they need something to pursue to define themselves by, to occupy themselves long enough so they don't have to realize that they're sitting still.<br>    <dd>  Zen is the act of letting go of all pattern, all meaning and embracing nothing for nothing. Living not for, but living. So I try to sit, but the urge of storytelling is always there to distract. Strangely enough, the story of Real Life is closer to Dada performance than to any six o'clock news report.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/dim.html"> Other Universe Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
