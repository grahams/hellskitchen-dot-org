The only letters of praise or hate that we have received came from a fan in Texas who stumbled upon our web site over the summer and an alumni who shares our distaste for the Reporter. I am reprinting them in the hopes that others may follow.<br>   <dd>  Maybe you didn't realize it, but the staff of Gracies Dinnertime Theatre is composed of only volunteers. There is no payment, other than the feedback we receive. When we ask a survey, we really want responses: we do keep track and have a running tally, even if the questions seem silly. If we made a mistake, either in our facts or in our layout...tell us. We're not the Reporter. When we say we're willing to give away a free GDTee shirt to anyone who can come up with a topic we can't write about, we mean it. And don't think someone else will write to us because, let me tell you, it's not happening.<br> <dd>    We realize that this editorial is the literary equivalent of asking for a sympathy-fuck, but we need the support right now. Let us know what you think, for better or for worse.<br>	 </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
