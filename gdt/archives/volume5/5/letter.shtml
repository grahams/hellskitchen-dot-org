This on line magazine is the most entertaining thing i have read in a very long time. I will be sure and bookmark the site and tell all my friends about it.<br>   <dd>  I found the articles witty and lovely satirical. I was even more impressed by the quotes used to accentuate the point being made. I am amazed that something this good has not been plastered all over the internet by now. You have found a new follower. I look forward to reading everything that you will put out in the future and i am saddened that not every site on the net can be as brilliant as this one.<p>Sincerely,<br><dd>Kevin Patterson<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
