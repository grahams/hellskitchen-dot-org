More importantly, freshman who are away from home for the first time have begun to feel that inner emptiness associated with being separated from that guy, or girl, or rock, or tree, or family, or smell in the air that they grew up with ("I LOVE the smell of pulp mills in the morning!"). They feel alone,  perhaps unsafe, and surrounded by subtle differences that can be as embarrassingly lethal as a duck attack.<br>  <dd>   Enter the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship (hereafter referred to in this document as "Those Smegging Gits"). Utilizing the Stockholm Syndrome, groups of this sort manage to attract and bind those who are searching for a social environment that will grant them a much needed sense of security and belonging. There's nothing wrong with that, except Those Smegging Gits are nothing but a weekly excuse to hide from the world by burying their noses in books and squawking to instrumental accompaniment. They&#153; attempt to dupe everyone by referring to themselves as a Christian group. Like any good investigative reporting staff, we sent our    writers out into the field to see what they could find.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images5/1.2.gif"><br><dd>   What is it that Those Smegging Gits do, besides "fellow"? Well, according to their web site, there are three major commitments:<br><UL><LI>to build collegiate fellowships characterized by meaningful relationships<LI>  to nurture one another in spiritual growth<LI>    to impact (Collision course!) our campus with the gospel of Christ (Ascension Day! Ascension Day! We're going down! Oh the lemmenity!)</UL><br><dd>    Ok. For what I've seen, they've fulfilled their stated commitments, but what have Those Smegging Gits done in the way of Christian charity? Last time I checked, my good friend James (James Burke? God, I wish. No, it was that other guy. You know, in the Bible.) had this to say about religion (so I assume it applies to a Christian group):<br><font size=+1><dd><I>"Pure religion and undefiled before God is this:  to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world."<br> 				<dd>				-(James 1:27)</I></font size><br>   <dd>  I can't remember the last time I saw a sign advertising, "I grow a good barn swallow, but my monkey keeps eating them," or for that matter, "The Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship is holding a canned food drive to help the needy." Hell, the fraternities and sororities have done more Christian-like activities.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#164;</A></a> With Rush week approaching, the 'farts (oops, that's a typo) and    'sorties (I never could spell) have been letting the campus community know that they raised around $14,000 for charities last year. Of course they have to do such activities to help stay the wrath of the people sick of late night parties and Rohypnol abuse. Nevertheless, it would appear that these pseudo-pagan socialites are more Christian in action than the religious groups on campus.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>  Then again, maybe all the Christ-kissers just don't have as many opportunities to be do-gooders as they used to. Thanks to the New Deal, the role of caring for the poor and destitute has been usurped by the State. Where there once was tithing, there is now taxes. Where there were good samaritans, there are now disgruntled social workers, nurses, doctors, and food stamps. Student religious groups have been reduced to the role of     cloistered monasteries in the Middle Ages: a group huddled in the dark as a      defensive measure. They're not hiding from Huns, Visigoths, or Norsemen, though, They&#153; are digging in against the threat of Secular Humanism (that great formless demonic mass, taunting and evasive, although that could just be a touch of indigestion. I'm always getting the two confused). <br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images5/1.3.gif"><br><dd>     All this could soon change thanks to the Christian Coalition and the Republican Party tag team (armed strictly with guns. You know, "Guns don't kill people, the veterans at the post office do."). With a massive federal deficit, it only makes sense that social programs will be the first to go. Of course the various churches around the country will take up the slack left in the absence of big brother's care. In a scheme fantastic in its long-rangedness, the federal deficit was intentionally run up during the Cold War for just this very situation. After the New Deal, the REAL leaders of the various American church franchises got together and formulated a plan to reinstitute their monopoly on charity. After years of scheming, they found their man for the job: Joseph McCarthy. Following the orders of church leaders, who in turn were drawing upon the vast resources and manuals remaining from the witch hunts, McCarthy made the American public so neurotic about communism that if their leaders had suggested cutting the defense budget, there would have been a civil war. Run the bill up as high as possible, and at just the right time, use the excuse of lowering the deficit to cut those horrible government-sponsored liberal social programs. Deviously clever, no? Back to task, though.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images5/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    Those who attend church once a week and pass by the starving child on their way to worship are not Christian, though they can drink the wine and eat the bread with a clear conscience. To be Christian is more than accepting Jesus as the son of a manic-depressive god and being able to quote scripture.<br>  <dd>   To be Christian is not meant to be easy. It is to be an active choice. It involves personal sacrifice, not a glee club meeting every Friday night at 7pm. And don't give me that crap about putting your house in order. You can do more to help   others by actually helping them than by trying to come to terms with your dislike for you uncle. So quit your fucking singing, put your special edition leather bound Bible on the shelf, and get in there and win one for the Jesus! Goooooooo Smegging Gits!<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#164;</A>  Actually, frats and bitch-houses are the pagan versions of nunneries and monasteries. They just have more wine, incest ("Hey Little Sister...do I have food in my unitooth?"), rape...well maybe not more. Those early Christians really knew how to swing, especially the popes and bishops. No wonder they didn't want priests to be married: no one you have to explain all those prostitutes to.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> Then again, perhaps it is simply a rare occurrence of Gelassenheit that is keeping the God Groups from advertising the fact that they spend every Saturday afternoon at the old subway tunnel giving away their earthly possessions and the evenings volunteering at AIDS clinics to give away free birth control and syringes. However, it's probably just good common sense that keeps them from advertising those Sunday evening jaunts to Red Barn for the late night formaldehyde parties.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/ma.html">Michelle Amoruso</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
