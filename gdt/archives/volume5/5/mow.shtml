That foray into the depths of my own soul, a time spent alone with only thoughts of autoerotic-asphyxiation and the Lord to keep me going. Let's get back on this crazy bandwagon called life and make fun of those who fell off (or were they pushed?!). Follow me again down the staircase and through the catacombs to the stench-ridden vaults that house the holiest of the holy, the Martyr of the Week. The <B>MOW </B>for <B>October 6-12</B> is <B>St Demetrius</B> (<B>October 8</B>). Other saints of note this week include <B>St Denis </B>(<B>October 9</B> (He picked up his head and walked 6 miles after being beheaded in Paris)) and <B>St Triduana</B> (also <B>October 8</B> (Plucked out her own eyes (In the tradition of St Lucy) and gave them to a would-be suitor because he kept remarking on their beauty)).<br>  <dd>   <B>St Demetrius</B> was in reality a simple deacon who was martyred in Dalmatia (now Serbia) under Diocletian. His rather illustrious (if not illusory) military career, the reason he is so venerated, is fictitious. This "Megalomartyr" (as he is known to the Greeks) is made out to be a warrior-saint in the same style as St George. He's invoked by the  peoples of the Balkans in the endless skirmishes, rebellions and wars that have been fought against the Austrians, Hungarians, Slavs, Turks and, of course, as continues even today, each other. Oh well, I guess it's better to be remembered, even if it is for some half-assed concoction of a history based on the need for a region that hasn't- had- a- rock- in- the- same- place- for- five- minutes- since- people- figured- out- you- could- throw- them  attitude toward diplomacy. Pinch me if I sound jaded....<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
