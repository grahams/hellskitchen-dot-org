I'm not what anyone might term religious by any sense, but I am excessively and eternally ethical. Putting aside the fact that I spent a great deal of time in Middle School and beyond trying to comprehend the insistence of my colleagues that, despite all the physical evidence, I say thee and thou all the time, I dress exclusively in black, I wear those silly hats, and I bake a damn fine oatmeal cookie. One of my associates was even under the impression that I couldn't possibly comprehend electricity; I'm afraid I only reaffirmed this conviction when I said, "What, you mean yon fluorescent banks are not even the eyes of heaven?" Us backward Friends couldn't have believed that fluorescent lights are an act of God; if they are, he's got one hell of a blinking problem. Such is the way of the world, and seventh graders are damned gullible.<br>    <dd> As of more recently, one of my philosophy teachers contended that I did not truly know my childhood religion well, for I seemed not to realize the central importance to Quakers of the idea of "the Light." I guessed the guy probably couldn't tell a good metaphor when he saw one. The Light is not like some silly flash bulb caught in your throat, but it refers to the spirit and the soul of every being, that every man is capable of finding truth and grace, no matter what their position or beliefs. I was taught that seeking the truth in my own life was the most important thing, and that my truth did not necessarily have to be the same as anyone else's. From the way I was taught, the Light was a search for truth.<br> <dd>    One of the songs I remember most fondly from my childhood started by saying:<br><table><tr><td width = 5></td><td valign = top width=230><I>"There's a light that is shining in the heart of a man,<br>   it's the light that was shining when the world began.<br>There's a light that is shining in the Turk and the Jew,<br>   and a light that is shining Friend in me and in you"</I><br></td></tr></table>  <dd>  For me this declared that each human was right in their own path as long as it is what they choose for themselves. The song later went on to say that the truth is more holy than the Bible. I was taught by a religion based in Christianity that if I could not find my truth in the Bible, I should look somewhere else. Most importantly, I discovered in this journey to respect the ideology of others as long as they have enough courtesy to respect that of others. I have to admit, I still have no space for the righteous.<br>  <dd>   In its past GDT has made more than enough jibes at various religions, but we tend to like to make fun of the hypocrisies we find within them. We're not here to poke fun at any particular person, unless they poke fun at themselves first by becoming the self-professed conscience of America. Besides, if we dish it out, we've got to be able to take it; give me your best shot, I can handle it.<br>  <dd>    There are people around the RIT campus who are under the impression that I was raised by wolves. If you think you can top that I entreat you to try.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/dim.html"> Other Universe Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
