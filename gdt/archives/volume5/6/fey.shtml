Found in many cultures across our world, it may simply reflect the dread of a child's inexplicable death. This fear of having a child spirited away into the Shadowlands remained strong even after Christianity was entrenched in the minds and morals of many cultures. The demon Lilith, Adam's first wife in Talmudic folklore, was said to murder sleeping infants, for she was cursed to never bare any offspring alive. I'd love to talk more about Lilith, but she'll have to wait for another time....<br>   <dd>  The accepted lore on changelings is that human children are stolen in order to invigorate the dwindling Tribes of the Moon with fresh, vigorous blood. Instead of such a "barn-yard breeding" approach, it may be the infusion of Man's creativity that is needed by the faeries.<br>   <dd>  The Faerie reasons for such heart-rending thefts may never be known or understood. What I can offer any prospective mothers reading are means of protecting your wee-one from the Gentry.<br><dd>     One of the most common means of safeguarding a child from faerie-snatching is through the use of names. many cultures feel that to know the true name of someone is to have power over them. This is partly the source for European "middle names" and may have played a role in the Church's granting a new name to individuals confirmed in the fold. To protect one's child, simply don't use their real name until they reach the age of five. By then, they should be safe.<br>   <dd>  The most obvious way to deter faeries is through the use of iron. Faeries abhor the base metal and simply placing an iron pan, or even a pin, under a child's bed will help protect them.<br>  <dd>   Sometimes, no matter the protective measure taken, a child will fail to thrive and waste away. At this point, the wizened creature in your child is a faerie, weakening the solid shell of the child to insure that it wouldn't be able to return. Fear not: there are means of exorcising those who have taken your child's essence. Unfortunately, the methods used can do a great deal of harm to a human infant. If worse comes to worse, here are some things to try:<br><UL><LI>Fill the baby's room with smoke. Faeries dislike smoke and will be driven away by it.<LI>Let the baby smoke a pipe. Again, it's the smoke thing.<LI>Starve the faerie out.<LI>Threaten to prick the child with an iron needle. There's an interesting twist on this in Eastern Europe and Russia. <LI>There, a metal scythe is used in place of the needle.<LI>Throw the baby toward a fire.<LI>Put the baby on a shovel and hold it over a fire<LI>Make it sneeze three times in a row.<LI>Convince it to speak in its native tongue<li>Don't let it eat any dairy products of greens. Only meat.</UL><p><dd>  It's time to smoother our little campfire. Go home. I'll tell you about faerie abductions next week.<br>   <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
