One of my favorite times of year has dragged its scaly ass into the present again. That's right: Columbus Day is here. Modern historical revisionists have gone out of their way to inundate American society with the fact that Columbus didn't make the virgin continent bleed. Leif Erikson, St. Brendan, Madoc, Jerry Lewis, Jesus, heck, there's even evidence that the Phoenicians and Egyptians stomped their little sandals on our amber waves of grain.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Regardless of who it was, they were all uncouth. It wasn't until the Europeans developed couthness (i.e. gunpowder) that they were able to fight off their red brothers. Time and again, prior to the "mini-iceage" that closed down the Greenland pop stand, the Vikings, with their ranks filled out with rock-chewing berserkers, were out-maneuvered and out-gunned by the natives of Vinland. <br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    In come the Europeans (version 7.5.5), outfitted with the newest in blunderbusses, smelling of royal ass-kissing, and generally being nasty to the natives (not that the natives weren't nasty, too); they brought the newest in pillaging technology to the Pillsbury Dough-boy world (Stab him in the gut and listen to him giggle. "Hee heee."). After a few years of digging in and fanning out, Shullushama of the Chickasaw summed it up by saying:<p><dd>"It has been a great many years since our white brethren came across the big waters and a great many of them has not got civilized yet; therefor we wish to be indulged in our savage state of life until we can have the same time to get civilized.... There is some of our white brethren as much savage as the Indian."<p><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images6/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   Well put. But imagine the blow to the European superiority complex when Sequoyah of the Cherokee sat down and created an alphabet for his people. Uneducated, speaking no English, and struggling against criticism from others in his tribe,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A> Sequoyah finally settled upon 86 characters for his new syllabic system in 1821. Despite a great deal of initial resistance, the system suddenly caught on.<br>    <dd>  Within a year of its being proven to work before the Chiefs, entering a Cherokee village must have been like walking into the ghetto: every available surface was covered with the characters of the new system. Trees, sides of homes, fence posts, and bark were used as slate (writing was done with voles. Oh, you can do it...just apply a lot of pressure) as neighbor taught neighbor the basics of the nineteenth century's version of the information superhighway. Taking only a month for the average Cherokee to learn, 99% of the tribe was literate in their own language by 1827 when the tribe bought a printing press and began to print weekly issues of "The Cherokee Phoenix."<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images6/1.4.gif"><br><dd>     After years of the Great White Father insisting the natives should become more civilized, the minute they became civilized enough to potentially read what was being written about them, there had to be a crack down. Enter the U.S. Government (stage left), led by a whiz-bang of a guy, Andrew Jackson, defending its moral superiority. Heathens reading in their own language? Hell, no! Move 'um out!<br>   <dd>  After the dust had settled and the blood dried up, over four K of Cherokees were killed off in that little nature hike...mostly women, children, the elderly, and redheads. Comes from having only granola and diseased blankets to eat.<br>   <dd>   On the upside, historians have a great name to use ("Trail of Tears," silly) and a really catchy army drill cadence:<br><table><tr><td valign = top width = 40></td><td valign = top><B>Ship those red de-mons out west<br>    <dd> 	and steal their fucking printing press!<br>Sound off!<br>     <dd> 	One, Two!<br> Sound off!<br>     <dd>	Three, Four!<br>Sound off!<br>    <dd> 	One-Two!<br>        <dd>  		Three-Four!</B><br></td></tr></table>  </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> The Cherry Plucker Prize goes to the Mayans, though. Hey, it's not who's first, but who does it best.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#131;</A>Not to mention a quasi-myth telling the story of how God had created the Indians and the Whites at the same time. The Indians, being the elders, were given a book. The Whites were the losers and had only bows and arrows. Because the Indians didn't know what to do with the book, their White brethren stole it when the Indians were looking at their bare feet after the Whites said, "Hey, your shoes are untied." Hence, the Whites' success at whipping up a good curry.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/ma.html">Michelle Amoruso</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
