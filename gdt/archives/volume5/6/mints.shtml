Now, this wasn't so bad; it prompted me at a very young age to have an active imagination and spend a lot of time outside tormenting Nature in all her glory. The one thing I could do without was having to reset all the digital clocks in the house. TVs, microwaves, stereos, VCRs: they all blinked in an asynchronous meter Stravinsky would have really grooved to.<br>  <dd>   Well, I want geosynchronous satellites over this planet, spaced at given intervals and all transmitting Greenwich Mean Time.<font color=blue>&#134;</font color> Then, I insist that all electrical appliances that have some sort of clock feature have a built-in receiver that automatically sets the time to GMT or Zulu time, depending on how obscure you want to be. All you'd have to do is have the dial on the underside of the device (oh, didn't I mention this?) set to what time zone you're in, and your clock would automatically set itself, damnit!<br>  <dd>   I suppose you could have the various time-keeping devices use the location system used to figure out where you are on the surface of the planet within a few yards...but that would be overkill.<p></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <hr width=100%><font color=blue>&#134;</font color> Actually, I just want one over me, but I'm willing to share.<br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mints.html">Other After Dinner Mints in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
