Follow the sounds of the faithful departed to the shrine we so fondly call the <B>Martyr of the Week</B>. This week, <B>October 13-19</B>, we celebrate the death of our own magnificent seven, the <B>Jesuit Martyrs</B> (<B>October19</B>). These patrons of Canada were missionary priests who came to convert the heathens of the New World    starting with the then "New France." These men in <B>blackrobes</B> (see the movie; If you think that your life seems to be on a downturn, watching this film will enlighten you to what a blissful    existence you enjoy) managed to convert their first lost soul after a mere 29 years of proselytizing. By the time the Jesuits began to convert any substantial number of locals (the peaceful Hurons), the Iroquois Nation moved in and slaughtered everyone. Seven Jesuit priests were sent above in a variety of ways. The Iroquois were very resourceful: they flayed skin, dismembered limbs with sharpened mussel shells by removing them piece-by-piece at each joint, scalped, scalded, decapitated, burned and/or ate our brothers for the cause.<br>   <dd>  Other martyrs of note this week include St Colman (October 13(A Scottish or Irish pilgrim who was mistakenly seized as a spy in Austria while on his way to Rome. His inability to speak German sealed his guilt in his captors' eyes and he was tortured on the rack and hanged.)) and <B>St Luke</B>, <B>the Apostle</B> (<B>October 18</B> (crucified with St Andrew at the ripe age of 84)).<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
