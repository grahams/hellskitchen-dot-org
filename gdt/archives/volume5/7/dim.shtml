These are some of the answers to several of your questions about me. But first, an introduction:<p>    <dd> A friend of mine informed me quite recently that according to an acquaintance of his, the campus in general has come to the conclusion that I am under the impression I can float. She was just asking my friend to see if this was in fact the case. So apparently I am now living with the delusion that my feet somehow don't touch the ground? Is that it?<br>   <dd>   As funny an idea as that is, I'm afraid it doesn't fly, and ironically enough, neither do I. Understand that if I truly thought I could float, I probably wouldn't be gyrating my limbs in a feeble attempt at locomotion. Besides, whether I am deluding myself or not, how would I be able to explain away shards of glass that become engrained in my soles, or bits of gravel, stubbing my toe, or more importantly, callouses you could sand most oak furniture with?<br> <dd>    No, I don't think I can float. There are many who have decided that I can, but hell, there is even one guy out there who is convinced I am Tabitha from Bewitched. So I don't know, you people seem gullible enough to believe just about anything.<br>   <dd>   Yes, it's true that I am semi-delusional. I have deluded myself into believing that the people on this campus spend more time then they ought obsessed with some flaky barefoot wench. And every time I seem to convince myself otherwise, this delusion comes back and slaps me in the face. It's funny how real delusional states of mind can seem, especially when they are so consistently backed up by hard evidence.<br>   <dd>  And for those of you out there who seem to be under the impression that I am just vying for attention, you should be informed that I have the social skills of a mollusk and have seldom found myself desirous of attracting attention for such ludicrous reasons. But, "Ah," you say, as if catching a flaw in this web I am weaving, "then why do you do it?" Not as good a question as you think. For, if I were to have some habit and were to cease it to be as all around me, regardless of the habit's origins, would not this new behavior be more of a ruse than the original.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/dim.html"> Other Universe & Me Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
