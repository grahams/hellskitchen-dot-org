Let's talk about one of the more disturbing (and also one of the more appealing) aspects of human/faerie relations: entrapment.<br>  <dd>   Faerie lore is filled with tales of mortals who have, either willingly or through subterfuge, been lured into the land of Faerie for an extended period of time. Nearly always, the human in question is extraordinary in some respect, usually in the arts. Poets, dancers, singers, and the beautiful of our race are like flares in the dark to faeries. And like moths to a flame, they can not help but be drawn...and claim what they want. The motivations of the faeries are undoubtedly tied with their possible dependency upon human creativity. Many humans and faeries are the result of the interbreeding between our two tribes, sometimes willingly, other times not. In many cases, humans were able to return to our world after what may have been a short period of time within Faerie, only to discover that days, years, or even centuries have passed within our world.<br>   <dd>  I'm hopeful that anyone who watches "X-files" regularly has picked up on the pattern I have presented here. Abductions by unknown (possibly unknowable) entities, interbreeding, time dilation.... Folks, the now trendy stories of alien abduction could easily be tales of faerie entrapment influenced by a different world view.<br>   <dd>  Faeries, being creatures of little physical substance, must cloth themselves in the perceptions of those that they meet. As the mechanistic technology of humans advanced, faeries were forced to cloth them selves in our hopes and fears. Still, the nature of faeries has remained them same.<br>    <dd>  The description of "greys" and some types of faeries is striking in its similarity: diminutive in height, over-large eyes, slight or non-existent nose, triangular face, greyish skin tones. The Nordic "blondes" that are also sometimes reported could easily describe any of the more human-like trooping faeries (particularly the Tuatha de Danann). And the reoccurring warnings about environmental damage would be consistent with a race so closely tied to the natural world (Although I could do an entire sociological/psychological paper on drawing the connection between the phenomena, I do not have the time or space. If you ask, I will point you in the direction of some literature that you might find interesting. Alternately, if you want to pay for me to do the research and write a wonderfully entertaining book on the topic, let me know and we'll talk. Oh, sure: someone has probably already done it, but I bet it's boring).<br>   <dd>  Far from being ground breaking, this idea was dealt with indirectly by Terry Pratchett in <I>Lords and Ladies</I>. To risk ruining an wonderful book, in a confrontation between a witch and the Queen of the Elves, the Queen's glamour fell for a moment, and the witch saw:<br>   <dd>  "-an almost triangular face, a tiny mouth, the nose hardly existing at all, but the eyes larger than human eyes...."<br>  <dd>   Does this mean that faeries are the distorted memories of past encounters with alien races? No. No more than the present stories of alien encounters are nothing but misinterpreted meetings with faeries. Undoubtedly, the truth is somewhere in between the two.<br>    </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG  width=500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
