In general I enjoy your publication, but due to your request for feedback, I decided to discuss a few things with you. Please hold on to the bar...<br>     <dd>  The recent editorials have made me wonder if Sean is not, in fact, a closet christian. It seemed that his editorials had a very christian message, if a somewhat hostile tone. Sean, you know how to contact me, I would be glad to discuss this at your leisure if you like. However, some points were not effectively made it seemed to me. The first editorial in question was titled "Its been nice, but I have to scream now." Or something similar to that. THat seemed like a rant, plain and simple. Which is fine, and taken for what it is, quite effective. However, the following editorial seemed like it was intended to be a calculated attack on the intervarsity christian fellowship. I personally endorse such attacks, but at times in the editorial you ranted, and it took away from the effectiveness of your point. The rest of your publication I have a limited commentary on, with one exception. I will deal with that exception in a moment. In general I enjoy Martyr of the Week, although I am not always certain of the point of it. On second thought, I am a little impatient, I think I will jump to my exception now.<br>    <dd>   The culinary critic I find to be an unsightly blemish on an otherwise quality publication. I have three main complaints with this feature. First, it is a miserable job of criticism or review. Secondly, it involves far too many inside jokes, and thirdly, the author generally irritates me with his style and pretentiousness. HIs reviews tend to be an opinion-fest with no real insight or commentary. He rarely has a justification for the things he says, he simply states that something sucks, and leaves it at that. Which leaves the reader wondering why it sucks. In addition, his inside jokes are irrelevant to the subject at hand, and occasionally just plain stupid. My example for this is is comment "Sean's gonna get mean! Oh no! Tiny tot terror!" First, to somebody who doesn't know Sean personally, that makes little sense. Second, it implies that short people can't be mean, can't have valid points, and can't be angry. Which is just plain stupid. And for my final point, the author hides behind the title of Damn Pseudonym. Admittedly, if I had written this, I might not want to put my name to it either. However, he should be willing to put his name by his words, and take the responsibility of them. The pseudonym, in my mind, shows a lack of integrity, and is contemptible. I have more to say about the culinary critic, but I think I will save it for later commentary.<br>     <dd>  Let me wrap this up with the main thing that I wanted to say. Thank you for producing this publication, and I sincerely hope you will keep up the good work. Thank you for your time.<br>                                              <dd>         Sincerely,<br>                                                   				<dd>	Kevin Eckles<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
