It certainly wasn't Thursday, July 4, 4004 BC, regardless what Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition would have you believe. I've heard about that fabled day countless times, and boy, everything great that ever happened, happened that day. People were friends and hung out together.  The air was clear, water was sweet, and mothers made apple pie instead of being beat up by the guy they're dating. Cars were big and got only 5 miles to the gallon, but that was ok, because money was good, and there was freedom: sweet, horrible freedom.<br>   <dd>   It must have been a really amazing day, because you hear the temporally disadvanteged talk about it all the time. They might not remember to unzip their flys, but they remember that day; it's all they talk about.<br>  <dd>   "Back in my day...ramble, ramble, candybars 10&cent; and as big as my arm, Babel, Babel<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a>(the slow and steady beat of a death rattle on the edge of some lively latino dance song, 'Cha, Cha, Cha!')."<br>  <dd>   Summer employment for most is nothing but exposure to those defeated souls in dead end jobs who tell you how things were better, "You know, back in the day."  The days of wine and roses? Day of the dead? The day after?<br> <dd>    Where the hell was I that day. Probably just a gleam in my father's eyes. Man, I missed everything.  And it only lasted one day?<br>    <dd>   Old theatres were in their prime back in their day.  It has been said that Liz Taylor and Richard Burton were the Tom and Roseanne of their day.  Does that mean that each person has his own day?  Martin Luther King gets a day annually and he has been dead for years. Where's mine?  Do I have to die violently first. The flag gets as many days as Jesus, whose only claim to fame was being nailed to a tree by the Romans for saying we should be nice to one another, and no one burns Him in protest or sews Him onto the seat of their Levis.<br> <dd>    They say each dog has his or her day.  What day is that? I've looked at a number of calanders and haven't found that particular day anywhere<br>  <dd>   What about other animals? Punxsutawney Phil get's a day, but who really cares? I want National Manitee Day. What about armadillos, it seems only fair since they can get leprosy. There could be huge games with teams of enthusiastic revelers kicking a lucky armadillo through stone rings. The losers get sacrificed in the tradition of all truely great sporting events (well, at least Mayan ones).<br>  <dd>   More importantly, how do you know when you have had your own day?  Smashing Pumpkins knew.<br>    <dd>  That day was the greatest....<br>  <dd>   It seems to me that most people know when "the day" occurred, only after its passed. The old codgers and young wash-ups<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> going on about the past have been angry ever since it slipped through their arthritic fingers. Maybe it is simply a syndrom of realizing there are more in one's past than in one's future. It can come as a great blow to the psyche, resulting in mid-life crissis, bungy-jumping grandma's (loosing their false teeth which plumit to the groud and kill some innocent teen complaining about how bored they are), and the desprate attempt to make the past seem more joyous than it was.<br>   <dd>  I hope my day hasn't passed, cause if I missed it what can I reminisce about when I'm toothless and am surrounded by family that have to humor me just to make sure I include them in my will?<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> I have no idea what day everything happened to everyone else.  I don't really care either.  Nostalgia's a thing of the past, and maybe that's what makes it so special; no one can change it or take it away from you.  So  . . . carpe diem (when it comes); its the only one you get.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Yes, this is an obscure reference that doesn't really apply to this article.
