Once more we pass over the threshold onto the hallowed ground that is the Martyr of the Week. This week, <B>October 20 -26</B>, we remeber our sister <B>St Margaret Clitherow</B> (<B>October 21</B>). England in the 16th century was not the best place to be a Catholic.  Margaret converted to Catholicism after her marriage to John Clitherow and took up residence in York. She was imprisoned for two years because of her faith, and when released provided her home as a refuge for priests. For this offense she was again arrested and this time condemned to death by pressing for refusing to enter a plea. If you are unfamiliar with this type of torture, let me elucidate. It's really very simple. The subject is tied down or shackled to the ground; A large wooden plank is placed on top of the individual; Weights (usually large stones) are then placed on top of theplank until the subject is pressed into confession. Those being tortured usually died from suffocation.<br>  <dd>   Other saints of note this week are <B>St Ursula</B> (also <B>October 21</B>) martyred with 11,000 virgins at Cologne by the Huns, <B>The Ursuline Nuns</B> (<B>October 23</B>) martyred in 1794 in France for reopening their school after the revolutionaries forbade them and <B>St Nmad</B> (<B>October 25</B>) had his eyelids cut off, ears cropped and tongue removed (through the back of his head!) for purportedly spouting heresy and lies against a superior of another order, the brothers of the Celibate Wounds. Gives new meaning to <I>torn into by liars</I>!<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
