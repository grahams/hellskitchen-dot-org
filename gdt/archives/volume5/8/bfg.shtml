All of the various time zones meet at the north pole (They don't meet at the south pole, because there are none but international scientists who can enjoy it down there, and nobody wants to think about what international scientists find fun.).<br> <dd>    Imagine, if you will, that you live in a house built upon the cross-section of all the time zones (this is a very basic precept for our modern-day understanding of time travel). There, time not only flies when you're having fun, but also when you go to retrieve the mail. The possibilities are endless, as well as proving Einstein's Theory of Relativity both correct and incorrect. You see, if you were suddenly to leave your significant other sitting in the living room and go outside and walk around the house three times, you would return to the S.O.'s location exactly three days in either the future or their past, and because time is relative to the observer, the significant one would still be in the living room waiting (at this point you would have an exceedingly good case to plea jet lag). So, dependent strictly on the direction you travel, clockwise or widdershins, you can either travel into the future or the past. Incidentally, this happens to be one of Santa's trade secrets.<br>    <dd> The next time someone tells you that you'll never get anywhere running in circles, just tell them that that depends entirely on where you are and how large those circles are.<br>	<dd>		-BFG<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
