Well, this week's installment is dedicated to the holiday of Samhain and helping to debunk some of the Church propaganda.<br>   <dd>  Common knowledge is that Halloween began as a pagan Celtic (pronounced "kel-tik") celebration honoring the Lord of the Dead, i.e., Lucifer. Unfortunately, this has no basis in fact. The first reference to the Lord of the Dead in relation to Samhain was made in "Collectanaea de Rebus Habernicis" (circa 1770's) by Col. Vallency. Where he got his information is a mystery....<br> <dd>    The long and short of it is that Samhain (pronounced "sa-wain") was the Celtic new year. Starting at sundown on October 31st, the pagan feast lasted until nightfall of November 1st and marked the beginning of winter. Any crops left in the fields after the 31st of October were claimed by marauding groups of faeries called Phookas. Attempting to harvest anything after Samhain invokes the wrath of these spiteful faeries, who have been known to kill cattle. Cows found mysteriously dead in rural parts of Ireland are said to have been "pooked."<br>   <dd>  Within in our own culture, revelers make a large amount of noise as the new year approaches in an attempt to scare evil spirits and trap them in the old year. For the Celts of the British Isles, the new year marked a dangerous time. On the long night of Samhain, the Sidh (the border between our world and that of Faerie) dissolves, allowing faeries, spirits of the dead, and divinity to enter our realm. Alternately, many unwary mortals have crossed into Faerie and been trapped when the Sidh reformed. My advice is that if you go out on the 31st, be kind to traveling strangers.<br>   <dd>  When the Romans invaded and conquered England in 43 n.z.d., they introduced the celebration of Feralia. In honor of Pomona, the Goddess of fruit trees, it was held on November 1st. Eventually Feralia and Samhain intertwined. The party game of bobbing for apples comes from the celebration of Feralia.<br> <dd>    Later, when Christianity became the dominant force in Northern Europe, Pope Boniface IV created All Saint's Day to replace the pagan celebration of Beltain. Celebrated on May 13th, Hallowmas, as it was called, was meant to honor all saints known and unknown. Later, in 835 n.d.z., Pope Gregory moved Hallowmas to November 1st to replace both Samhain and Feralia. The night of October 31st was called "Hallow's Even" ("Holy Evening"), and was eventually shortened to Hallow e'en.<br>   <dd>  As for jack o' lanterns, the story is all in the name: Jack of the Lantern. According to an Irish folk story, a cruel miser named Jack tricked Lucifer into climbing an appletree. While treed, Jack carved a cross in the truck, trapping the Fallen Angel. After Lucifer promised not to claim Jack's soul at his death, Jack helped Him down.<br> <dd>    Upon Jack's death, he was turned away from Heaven because of his cruelty in life. When Jack attempted to enter Hell, Lucifer, a being of His word, refused to claim his soul. When Jack asked where he was to go, Lucifer replied, "Return from where you came," throwing an ember from Hell to Jack. Jack took a turnip, carved it out, and placed the eternally burning ember into it to light his way. Now, he is cursed to eternally wander the earth.<br>   <dd>  Enjoy the new year, fellow faeriephiles.
