I dislike doing this, but on occasion there just aren't any really good martyrs.  This weeks Martyr of the Week (October 27-November 2) is just a token martyr. He was killed for his beliefs, but he's just not funny or gross or even cut up and shared by multiple churches. The Martyr of the Week is (pathetic pencil tapping,poor excuse for a drum roll please) <B>St Saturninus</B> (<B>October 30</B>). Saturninus was martyred in Sardinia (look on the map, this isn't a geography lesson) under the Diocletian Persecution&#153;. He was beheaded during a pagan festival honoring Jupiter, most likely due to his refusal to pay tribute to the deity in question (or maybe he was a very poor dancer).<br>   <dd>   On a more interesting note, this week also gives us feast days for <B>St Jude</B> (<B>Oct 28</B> (beaten to death with a club)), <B>St  Marcel</B> of Paris (<B>Nov 1</B> (While bishop of Paris our Saint confronted a devilish serpent that was troubling a local cemetery. He beat it with his staff, wrapped it in his robe, and expelled it from the grounds. For this deed he is invoked against Vampires--something to remember for Thursday.)), and <B>All Souls Day </B>(<B>Nov 2</B> (The day set aside to remember those souls trapped in Purgatory, between Heaven and Hell, the unfortunates waiting out eternity in Limbo (the state of being, not the dance).<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
