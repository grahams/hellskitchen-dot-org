Well, it all started with a question sent to "Ask BFG" inquiring as to who "They" were. Our barefooted one answered the question as only she could, but here at GDT, the research never ends. We raided shadowy corners of libraries, searched through mildewed tomes (aka PTA newsletters), and misused the mighty resources of Hell Inc. Nearly a year later, we have more information for you. With it, we start this new column dedicated to the agenda of the Religious Right:<p><dd>	"When They&#153; [Editors' note: capitalization and addition of the trademark symbol added by the editors] teach children in public schools about history, They&#153; knowingly omit all references to God and Christ, including those that are foundational to our country's beginning. Then They&#153; tell us uneducated masses that the founding fathers struggled to keep church and biblical influences out of politics. These are bold-faced lies. (Violates Ninth Commandment).... "They&#153;" are (in random order): the National Organization of Women (NOW); the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); the National Educational Association (NEA); pagan judges of federal state and local benches; the Hollywood elite; Act-Up; Queer Nation; North-American Man-Boy Love Association; the majority of newspaper editors and journalists; the majority of television's elite; the American Medical Association (AMA); an army of university deans and professors (educated way beyond their intelligence); the major networks; the Ted Kennedy crowd; the friends of Hillary Crowd; the faceless crowd of bureaucrats that have infested our nation; the messianic social-engineers that skulk around in small communities across the nation promoting "tolerance"; Planned Parenthood (curriculum and condoms); the Madonna crowd; the Green Peace crowd; the Al Gore eco-freak crowd; Earth First; People United for the Separation of Church and State; various social service agencies; the Children's Defense League; the child-killers and spineless career politicians who allow these lunatics to terrorize them into promoting iniquity; and the innumerable cadres of bureaucratic, statist thugs who are on a mission to rid the earth of Christian influence and biblical morality. That's who "They&#153;" are, just to name a few."<br><table><tr><td width = 300 valign = top align = right>-Randal Terry, <I>Why Does a Nice Guy Like <br>Me Keep Getting Thrown in Jail?</I>,<br> 	          pp 138-139, (Huntington House <br>Publishers/Resistance Press, 1993).<p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/rw.html">Other Religious Wrongs in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
