So we thought up the idea of a literary scavenger hunt. Each week of volume 6 we will print three quotes from various literary sources or other well-known documents. These quotes will be graded by difficulty and will recieve corresponding point values. Participants must guess the source of the quote and the author if applicable. At the end of the quarter all points will be tallied up; a winner will be publicly announced in the first issue of volume 7.<br>   <dd>  Because this money was a donation, everyone but the head editors of GDT is qualified to enter. Watch for it!</B><br></font color></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/ads.html">Other Ads in this Volume</A><br> <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> - <A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
