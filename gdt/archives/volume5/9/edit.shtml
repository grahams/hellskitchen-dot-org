After I picked up Hell's Kitchen from the printers, however, I discovered that GDT had pulled a Reporter. So, I'd rather address those problems and I'll say something about the most pious one if I have room.<p>  <dd>   From time to time, GDT makes some major layout errors. Last week was one of those times. Because of deadlines (i.e. when the printers go down at night), it was impossible to put our images in and make sure everything looked ok when printed. Consequently, our main article had a few letters at the ends of words covered by our  front page illustrations. As if that weren't enough, the column "Live, Learn and Pass It On: A Critical Review" had words totally obscured.<br>  <dd>   Now, in my eyes, the role of any publication (contrary to the whizzes that bring you such graphic disasters as Ray Gun and RIT's official new-mag, the Reporter) is to convey specific information. When text is obscured by graphics, or is even omitted, the publication has gone against its     dharma.<br>  <dd>   As one of the head editors of GDT, I take full responsibility for the graphical errors last week. We have reprinted "Live `n Learn" for your entertainment. My staff felt that the front page errors were minor, and I agreed. That material is not reprinted, mainly due to space constraints.<br>   <dd>  What I find most disturbing about all this is that no one sent us mail complaining about what a shit job we did. Even last year, when we failed to continue a front page article (we really screwed the poodle that time), we didn't hear a word from readers. I implore you all to send mail to publications that are failing in their job to convey information clearly. Layout is important, but it must be secondary to the text it is meant to augment.<br> <dd>    If you read any publication, be it GDT, Melancholy Predator, the Reporter, or whatever, and find that it is obscuring text, or not making it clear where articles begin or end, than tell them. Write them a letter. Give them a call. Complain. Your silence only implies that your acceptance of unreadable material.<br>  <dd>   That having been said, let's talk about the Pope.<br>  <dd>   Earlier this year (volume 5, issue 4) I wrote an editorial titled, "It's been nice, but I have to scream now." In it, I mentioned, just as an aside, that Creationism is not a issue mentioned in political discussions anywhere in the world except the USA. The exact quote was:<br>   <dd>  "...no where else in the Western world is Creationism still an issue. I'm sure even the Pope doesn't give Creationism anything more than lip service."<br>   <dd>  Well, bless my prophetic soul! Nearly a month later, the Vatican released a statement from the Pope saying, "new knowledge leads us to recognize in the theory of evolution more than a hypothesis." He went on to say that current that the available scientific data, "constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory."<br> <dd>    Ok. Give myself and Biology a pat on the back.<br>  <dd>   Hope to be bringing you more of tomorrow's news today....<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
