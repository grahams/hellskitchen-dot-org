Huge tribes of Oompa Loompas turning the ground orange with their presence.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Eventually, Watusi hunters discovered the Oompa Loompa hidden valley of bliss during the Watusi Age of Discovery (52 BT).  After decades of cooperation, the two dissimilar tribes had reached a symbiosis that few other human populations have enjoyed.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a> The Watusi would thatch the roofs of the Oompa Loompa homes, while the Oompas put in duty as pest control, provided the spit for building homes (like a wasp, dummy), and were the unit of measure.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#1">&#164;</A></a> In hindsight, the Watusi actually were the ones getting the better deal, but if you were 2.5 meters tall and had to deal with a bunch of orange guys that were 1 meter, who would get the better deal?<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images9/1.1.gif"><br><dd>   As with all Golden Ages, this euphoric life of rodent catching and roof thatching couldn't last. It ended quite innocently: two Watusi walking side by side ran into a Oompa Loompa, the short little guy got caught up in their knees, and<br>   <dd><font size=+1><B>   POP!</B></font size><br>   <dd>  Suddenly the air was filled with orange dust. The Watusi, instinctively knowing that Something Had Happened, stood their ground as the fines filled the air. Almost against their will, the towering tribesmen began licking the air, savoring the sweet, orange ambrosia. All activity in the village stopped as the Oompa Loompas present saw what had happened, and the two Watusi eyed each other knowingly (Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink).<br>   <dd>   In one of those memorable moments when simple 1+1=2, a2+b2=c2, Oompa loompa + mauling speed = yum, the larger of the two giants calmly walked up to a cowering Oompa Loompa and clobbered him over the head.<br>   <dd><font size=+1><B>   POP!</B></font size><br>   <dd>  "Tang!"<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> shouted the excited Tribesmen inbetween excited licks.<br><dd>     Tang. You remember it: the astronauts drink it. High in vitamins, all your essential nutrients, the damn stuff is like a Schmoo, or more specifically, like a discorporated Oompa loompa. (On the downside, you have to deal with the toxic orange dye. Warning: Not to be used by children under 6 years of age unless recommended by a dentist or physician. If more than 3 metered doses (1 oz.) are actually swallowed, give several glasses of milk and contact a physician for further advice. Do not get on carpets, clothing, or counters.).<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images9/1.2.gif"><br>    <dd>  Thus began the genocide of the Oompa Loompas. After all, they didn't make really good units of measure, and they are pretty tasty.<br>   <dd>  If it wasn't for the imperialism of the Europeans, filling every crack and crevice with their need to Christianize, homogenize, and pulverize everyone, the Oompa loompa would be as lost as most of those tribes of Israel. The grandfather of the infamous Willy Wonka first happened upon the diminished tribe in the 1870's; offering to relocate them to the United States in return for their assistance in a factory he wanted to build, they eagerly accepted.<br>  <dd>    Just another bunch of slaves, bound for the new world.<br>    <dd>  Now, generations after being rescued from powdered oblivion, the luckless orange ones reside in Willy Wonka's Concentration Camp: the world of Dairy Queen gone horribly wrong. Where's the ACLU when you need them? Orange midgets forced to work and live in a windowless factory for a tyrannical, yet lovable, loon. Forced to sing and work, probably under the influence of random hallucinogens (What other boss do you know of that encourages workers to lick the wallpaper? I guess it's better than licking the air.) without compensation. Talk about a civil rights violation! It's not hard to figure out that the Oompa Loompa songs are in reality a sizable repetoir of spirituals, possibly with coded messages revealing the whereabouts of the Secret Oompa Loompa Underground Railroad.<br>   <dd>   Thanks to our resident anthropologist, we have obtained a copy of one of the Oompa Loompa spirituals and analyzed it.<p><IMG  width=500 align = center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images9/song.gif"><p><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images9/1.3.gif"><br>  <dd>   The escape route from Willy Wonka's Sweat Shop is only through the chocolate river and up the outlet tube! Anyone too fat would end up getting stuck and burst into powder from the buildup in pressure. Bad for the Oompa loompa, good for the chocolate. All those who have seen the documentary, think back to when that young boy fell into the river and got lodged in one of the outflow pipes. The looks on the faces of the Oompa Loompas was that of fear. "What if the Massa finds out about our escape route?" Luckily, he sent only Oompa Loompas to retreave the luckless child.<br>   <dd>  At the chocolate factory, however, the horror never stops: when the Oompa loompa reach such an age that they can no longer withstand the backbreaking labor forced upon them, they are "retired." It is said that the Oompa Loompas who have worked hard their whole life spend the end of their days in a rest home within the factory.<br> <dd>   But.<br>  <dd>   No one has ever seen seen this fabled home. Those poor souls are herded into the extensive Tang works like horses to a glue factory. Employing the descendants of the Watusi that immigrated to the United States to mash the elderly into uncut Tang, Willy Wonka continues traditions of hatred and regulated genocide.<br>   <dd>  Please, write your local Congressman. Help Sally Struthers save the poor Oompa.... Oh, fuck 'em. Kill all the orange freaks! Great heaps of Tang for everyone! <br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Prior to the arrival of Europeans, Oompa Loompa herds could cover whole countries of what is now Africa. Given, they were small countries, but it's still pretty impressive.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#131;</A> Except for the Christians and Romans. You see, without the Christians, the Romans would have been shit out of luck when it came to entertainment. As for the Christians...well, where would they have gotten their concept of persecution and learmed all the nasty things to do to Mother God worshippers of the Middle Ages?<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#164;</A> Ironically, the Watusi unit of measure, the Loompa, is equal to one meter. Funny old world, isn't it.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#165;</A> "Tang," in the native language of the Watusi, means : "sweet tasting, squashed orange midget, which we can all stand around and taste by simply licking the air." Just another example of words that don't translate well...kind of like the Japanese Computer company, Wang. Someone should have warned them....<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/ma.html">Michele Amoruso</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
