Once again I make the trip (I speak in the singular because I always seem to be alone) to the shrine of suffering, that elusive prize, the Martyr of the Week. The honor for the week of <B>November 3-9</B> is bestowed upon the innumerable <B>martyrs of Saragossa</B>, Spain (<B>Nov. 3</B>). This group was another of the multitude put to death under the Diocletian persecution. The prefect Dacian, sent from Rome to uphold and enforce the laws, banished all xians from Saragossa. Ever the tactician, he took this opportunity to "sick the dogs on them." His soldiers slaughtered them as they left the city <I>en masse</I>. No one was spared--it was an equal opportunity massacre. 18 of these martyrs are venerated in a special ceremony <B>April 16</B> (Mark your calendars!).<br>     <dd> Other saints of note this week include <B>St Martin De Porres</B> (<B>Nov. 3</B> as well (He is the patron saint of Hairdressers, Public Health Workers, People of Mixed Race and Peruvian Television)) <B>St Willibrord</B> (<B>Nov. 7</B>(A conga-like dance undertaken at his tomb once a year is supposed to cure participants of epilepsy, convulsions, and lumbago)), The <B>Four Crowned Martyrs</B>  (<B>Nov. 8</B> (A group of stonemasons martyred under , gee... let me guess--Diocletian?, for refusing to carve the statue of a pagan god)), and lastly <B>St Benen</B> (<B>Nov. 9</B> (People are miraculously forced to regurgitate intestinal worms at our saint's tomb thus, curing them of this dreaded blight on humanity. )) Until next week, Trinity Labors On.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
