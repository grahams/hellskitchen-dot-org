He is forever on the edge; any given      person to encounter him will have pretty even     chances that he will either commit a      spontaneous act of violence, or a menacing      act of kindness (the type of kindness you      want to keep as far away from as possible).      He looks as though every muscle in his body      is going through a twenty-four hour-a-day      charlie horse,  You almost feel the urge to      teach him lamaz, to help him through the      tough times.<br></td><td valign = top width=250><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol5/images9/rider.gif"><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/rider.html">Other Rider Cards in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <font size =+1><b>Illustrator:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume5/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
