Little information has reached Western countries, however, due largely in part to the crack down by the government. The students have taken it upon themselves to disseminate information via the internet...<br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> From: "Leonid Oknyansky" <LFO930@stud.aubg.bg><br> Date: Wed, 27 Nov 1996<br> Subject: For Your and Our Freedom<p> Dear Colleagues,<br>  <dd>    Considering the information blockade in our country (Yugoslavia), we  are trying to inform universities all over the world via Internet about the events in Belgrade.  The situation in Belgrade and Serbia is becoming more and more dramatic.<br>  <dd>    The students' protest has been going on for three days now, with the full support from our teachers.  All the larger university centers in Serbia are also in protest, together with the Belgrade University. We are asking you to inform students of your universities as to what is happening here.  Any kind of support coming from you will be highly appreciated.<p></td><td valign = top> <center><B>Declaration of Decency</B></center><br>   <dd>   We, the students of the Belgrade University, support the citizens of Serbia, who demand the protection of their rights, guaranteed by the Constitution.  Brutal violation of law and annihilation of regular electoral results are the unprecedented attack on the basic principles of democracy.  We are not taking sides between the party in power and the opposition--what we insist upon is the rule of law. Any government unwilling to acknowledge the electoral defeat is not worth of our support, and we are overtly opposing it.<br>     <dd> Therefore, we demand:<br>  <dd>    Immediate establishment of State's Electoral Committee, which will be formed on proportional principles by the parties that took part in a second ballot.  The purpose of this Committee will be to objectively establish the outcome of the second ballot.  We appeal on all participants of the current political crisis to abstain from any and all violence.  The students of the Belgrade University will endure in their protest.<br>      	<dd>			-University of Belgrade<br> </td></tr></table> <table width = 500><tr><td valign = top align = center><font size=+2><B>The official site of the Student protest: http://galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~protest96/ </B></font size><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
