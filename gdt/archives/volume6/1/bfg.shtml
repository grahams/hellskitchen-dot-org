When he died, his will had these instructions for the division of his land among the sons:<br><dd>1. Each son had to be the neighbor to all the others.<br> <dd>2. The land of any two brothers had to have at least one edge in common, not just a point.<br><dd>3. Each brother's land had to be in one piece.<br>		<dd>		-Mobius<p></B>Dear Mobius,<br>    <dd>  There are a couple of various solutions to this problem, choose one or mix and match.<br>   <dd>  Ain't two dimensional geometry a bitch?<p><B>Answer #1: "Mole Man"</B><br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/bfg1.gif"><br> <dd>    Mole boy is the method in which the father, or the siblings in his absence choose the most hated brother of the family and thereby decree a substantial proportion of the mineral rights to a portion of the land, without actually giving him any above ground rights to the share of acreage <B>(Figure 1)</B>.<p><B>Answer #2: "Six Feet Under"</B><br>  <dd>   Similar to the "Mole Boy" solution, this one includes the idea of one superfluous, shat on member of the family. However in this version, it is more likely that it is the siblings duty to choose who among the siblings will pull the short end of the straw, so to speak.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/bfg2.gif"><br>   <dd>  In the "Six Feet Under" method of dealing with the will, the least popular brother is actually "removed from the running" perhaps by a nicely placed tire iron. Whatever the method, the fifth brother will invariably find himself requiring less space originally expected. In fact, all the space he'll need is a nice little plot of land approximately six feet under in which to lay his final remains. His body would be burried at the apex of all of their lands, allowing each brother a small patch of foot room to admire their handy work from <B>(Figure 2)</B>.<br>   <dd>  One of the benefits of this plan is that it will accommodate a fair amount of deviation as to the number of brothers to be planted.<p><B>Answer #3: "Mountain Man"</B><br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/bfg3.gif"><br>    <dd> This particular choice depends entirely upon the geography of the region. Assuming the acreage has a hill or mountain in it's center, this method will do. In this method one brother owns the inside of a mountain or hill, but not the surface of the mountain, nor the mineral rights to the land below it. He could build a house in there, while two of the brothers would share it's surface, and the other two would share it's mineral rights. Alternately they could build a tunnel under his house to connect their two plots of land.<B>(see figure 3)</B><p><B>Answer #3 -Variation1: "The Old Hermit"</B><br>   <dd>  This variation allows even brothers who are not given a plot of land which possesses a hill to share in this method. "The Old Hermit" simply requires that the brothers first build their own mountain or hill most economically utilizing land fill to accomplish their goal. In this scenario, they would actually make some extra cash from their respective state by taking the... troublesom material out of its hands. The most humane thing to do with the cash after that would be to buy a life supply of Renuzit&#153; deoderizers for whomever ends up living in Mount Dumpster Dune.<p><B>Answer #4: "Easy Answer"</B><br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/bfg4.gif"><br>  <dd>   If all of these other methods have become too involved for one family of five to consider, then the easy way out would be to simply split the acreage into five even pieces which meet at the center. For anyone, unless otherwise restricted, who owns land in fact owns the property plus all of the mineral rights beneath that plot of land, right down to the molten core (which is treated as if it were a body of water) <B>(Figure 4)</B>.<p><B>Answer#5: "Parallel Plots and Alternatives"</B><br>   <dd>  Is merely a space of the usual GDT jargon involving alternate realities. So in fact one of the brothers, under the assumption that there exists a different reality for every different possibility in the universe, could simply take possession of all of the available land. Assuming that in at least one other reality one of his other brothers owned all the land, they would be certain that they not only lived near to all their other brothers, but that they only had to pass through an alternate probability to wave hello (no figure available, as any sort of reconstruction tended to hurt my head).<p>		<dd>		-BFG<p><center><table  width = 200 border><tr><td valign = top><center><B>Do you have any questions for BFG?<br> Send them to her care of diablo@csh.rit.edu.</B></center><br></td></tr></table>    </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
