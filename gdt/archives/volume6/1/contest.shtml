This is the final week of the Literary Scavenger Hunt and we have as of yet to be sent anyone's answers to the quotes. This is your last chance to<br> <center><font size=+3><B>Win $75</B></font size></center><br>  <dd>   If you are under the impression that you shouldn't send in your answers because you may only know a couple of the quotes, think again. Right now we have zip from anyone. At this point, answering just one quote could win the scavenger hunt. That may change, but how can it hurt to take a chance on seventy-five dollars? The probability of winning is better than the lottery. So go ahead and try it. The idea is simple: For the next few weeks we print a series of quotations from various literary sources. Some are very well known, others less so. Each quote has a point value associated with it, based on the difficulty of the question, in addition to periodic "Bonus Questions." The winner of the contest will be the person who gets the most points. The prize is $75 dollars, and if the winner chooses, they may also become privy to the secrets of "Cafe Diablo," the most diabolical coffee in the world (and the official drink of Hell Inc.). The winner's name will be posted in the first issue of volume 7.<br></td><td valign = top width = 150 bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><font size=+1><B><center>GDT Literary Scavenger Hunt Rules and Regulations:</B><p></font size></center>   <dd>  This contest is open to everyone, with the exception of the two head editors of Gracies Dinnertime Theatre.<p><B>Send answers to diablo@csh.rit.edu, or send replies to:  GDT, 472 French Rd, Rochester, NY  14618</B><p>If you should happen to miss any of the issues from volume 6, you may find them on our web site: http://www.rit.edu /~diablo /gdt /extras /contest.html </font color><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td width=500 valign = top><font size=+1><B><center>All answers must be sent to GDT by March 1st, 1997.</B></font size></center><p>Requests for the complete list of quotes should be sent to <B>diablo@csh.rit.edu</B>.
