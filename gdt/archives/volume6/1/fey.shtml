Humans intuitively understand this  when they enter such a place: they are filled with an overwhelming sense of wonder, that the world is new and still courses with raw Power. These are the truly wild places, and on them, numerous shrines and religious structures have been built, altering the nature of the power. Imagine what the first European explorers felt when they first saw Niagara Falls, surrounded by wilderness. Now compare that to what a Japanese tourist feels when they visit Niagara Falls and visits the memento shop: the power has been tapped. It is no longer raw, and can never be again. Man's increased numbers have necessarily meant his expansion into the more isolated areas of the world where any passages between the worlds might be. The doors to Faerie are slowly and systematically being closed in these twilight years by the removal of wilderness. Hand-rails, clearly marked trails, and snack shops make the magickal areas of our world into places to visit and photograph over a weekend. Still beautiful, but beautiful in a controlled fashion.<br>  <dd>   Popular and classical fiction maintain that children enter Faerie far easier than adults: that somehow children are more "enchanted." Tolkien in his essay Tree and Leaf felt that the fundamental difference between adults and children was that children take stories about Faeries and read them "...as tales, that is, not studies them as curios. Adults are allowed to collect and study anything, even old theatre programmes or paper bags."<br>    <dd>  The gate to faerie is not bared to all adults who attempt to enter. The proof of this exists within the literature written by adults, set within or along the grey, shifting boarders of Faerie. Many traditions state that the night of Samhain marks the one time in the year when the boundaries between our world and the others lower. That night, Gods and faeries, the dead and demons can walk among men, and mortals can pass behind the veil. If they are not vigilant, they can become trapped in that moon-lit realm. Even on that special night, it is doubtful that the land of Faerie would open unto a city street. It is the wild places that are needed.<br> <dd>    In story after story, the thin membrane separating our world from Faerie allows only those who fully believe in the land they are about to enter to pass. It is as Helen Lourie wrote:<br> <dd>   "Children pass easily from the incomprehensible adult world to the equally mysterious world of fantasy...they have acquired less disbelief to be suspended before they can enter into the Kingdom of Never-Never."<br>  <dd>   Although humans have been known to force their way into Faerie (much to their eventual displeasure), much more common are the tales of Faerie opening itself to individuals. Faerie lore is littered with tales of faeries being attracted to artists, poets, and musicians. It is the eternal children of our tribe who can most easily enter Faerie.<br>  <dd>   The doors to Faerie can not be located on any map. They do not exist in physicality, nor are they only in the mind. The gates to Faerie open when one is filled with wonder by their surroundings. In that instant of rapture, one stands on the edge of Faerie.<br>    </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG width=500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
