He predicted that the rate of growth in the human population would soon surpass the planet's available num-nums. The Apocalypse Boys would ride supreme across the face of the earth. Luckily for us, Malthus could not have predicted that plant breeding techniques would allow food production to increase far faster than the population.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#164;</A></a><br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    Now, our planet undulates with over 5 billion hominids and new gloom sayers are polishing their soap boxes. Current estimates, this time taking into account projected increases in food production, say the planet can support anywhere from 9 billion to 12 billion humans. It's not a matter a space; Antoine de Saint Exupery himself said, "Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> inhabitants who people its surface were to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled upon a small Pacific islet." He was not being accurate, of course, he was merely using sensationalism (In those times, showing an ankle was considered sensationalism.) to make a point: it's quality, not quantity (not necessarily of humans, but of life and living it).<br> <dd>    In 1992, at approximately the time of year when a bunch of yahoos get all trussed up in neon orange suit jackets and drive around all day hoping to "bag that big one," I found myself with a bunch of protesters outside the Irondequoit town hall picketing the latest vogue in controlling the blossoming animal populations called, "bait and shoot." The rally revolved around a simple problem: with man's expansion across the globe, he has obliterated or chased away the natural predators of deer. Sure, people have dogs, but watching a pack of dachshunds trying to bring down a deer is laughable. So, in the name of mastery, man dons the mantel of Top Predator and lets the various chin-less weekend warriors strut their funky stuff.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>   The Democrat and Chronicle took my picture. I held a sign saying, "The human race is overpopulated, shoot them!"<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a> Little did I know then what an absolutely brilliant scheme this bait and shoot thing was...when given a broader purpose.<br> <dd>    Let's face it, I had a damn good point to make a few years ago, and, thanks to the Reporter, arrogance, and hard work, now I have a forum. People are overpopulated and crowded, and when any good population becomes too crowded, even the best of them have a tendency to become peckish and dangerous. Yes, humans are naturally Gregorian,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a> but only in groups of 20 or so. Hit 300,000 and there's just too much opportunity for nastiness. If you want an example of what humans are really like in a group, covertly watch a group of kids below the age of five. They are the meanest, nastiest beasts to one another. Civilization mellows them out a bit, but that horrid little creature is inside each and every adult, just ready to throw a tantrum when their favorite football team loses the Big Game. Hell, you only have to look at English Football games to realize that.<br>    <dd>  Yeah, too many people, people are poopie-heads in groups...any idiot can look at a problem and say, "Oh, well THAT's what's wrong." It takes an extraordinary individual to illuminate the solution. So you think the solution to our problem is to colonize the oceans and head that wagon train into the great expanse of space? Well, that may work for the nomadic-non-social, spatially-unchallenged, or the amoeba-wanna-bes, but it just won't cut it for your average blue collar schmo. Drastic measures must be taken for the overall mental stability of the human race. Optimally, I'd like to see at least half of the world's human population disappear. Don't get me wrong, I don't want them killed, per-say...just not here anymore. In the absence of the Rapture, let's look at our options:<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   Genocide has been proven effective but it's too messy, wastes too many resources, and doesn't leave enough variation in the gene pool (I don't swim in your toilet. Don't breed in my pool). Genocide's sister, Eugenics, is a far sighted plan ("Father! The sleeper has awoken!") perfect for our future hordes, but what do we do about the ones we've got now?<br>   <dd>   There's always forced sterility (a subsiderary of Eugenics). Nearly as far-sighted as eugenics, the same problem remains: millions of pesky gilded eunics. You've got to feed them, cloth them, and give them plenty of women to bathe and peel grapes for. Besides, the orange clad yahoos have a hard time with their sperm counts as it is, thanks to their tight jeans and chain smoking.<br>  <dd>   Probably the most practical way to cut down on the number of available humans is through scientific experimentation. You thought LD50 (lethal dose 50%: the amount of a virus or bacteria that kills 50% of those infected) was something scientists just knew? It took thousands of criminals making the ultimate sacrifice to give us the information doctors use daily to save people from diseases that would keep the human population at a manageable size otherwise. Unfortunately, there are just so many times you can say, "Huh. Ebola really killed those 10,000 people quick. I suppose you want results in triplicate?" Too much work.<br><IMG align = right SRC="images1/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    Bait and shoot targeted evenly toward all demographics..... Ah, there's the rub.<br>  <dd>   Oh the beauty of if it. Imagine a picturesque country field in late fall. The sun is just coming up and there is a frost covering the ground. In the background, Rossinni's William Tell Overture is playing gently. In the center of the field is a 1970 Ford Fairlane, its rust gleaming like a squirrel in the morning light. Mounted on blocks, its empty wheel wells are like dark pools of water, enticing small children to lower their heads and drink deeply. Slowly from the woods emerges Jolene. Timid at first, she sees the vehicle and approaches in awe. As she slowly reaches out a reverent hand...<br>  <dd>   Fucking BOOM!<br>  <dd>   Birds flutter from the trees and the shot echoes into the distance. All that's left of Jolene after the hollow-tipped, teflon-filled slug finished its job is her halter, a-flutter in the wind. It rises on an early morning thermal, a creature from the past taking its first, tentative flight across long forgotten lands, but soon falls to the lush green grass, and the world has one less breeder.<br>  <dd>    You see, you just have to know how to choose the right bait for the desired demographic.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#164;</A> However, crops are constantly at risk to infectious agents. The Potato Blight&#153; of the 1800's would look like missing a meal if the world's grain were attacked by hordes of pesticide-resistant locusts with thousands of pointy, bitey teeth. Or not even anything so Biblical. A mild change in weather patterns over the Great Plains (like, say, really dry weather in the summer, and constant flooding in the spring) could turn the amber waves of grain into roving dunes of sand.
