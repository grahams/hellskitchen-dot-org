Like the caterpillar entering the cocoon, the duckling into the swan, Slowdive into Mojave 3...this isn't the end but a new beginning. I was simply going to start this quarter afresh with a new column, but began to see that it would be rude to dismiss my mistress (the only one I'll ever have I'm afraid) without a glance and a wave. I've enjoyed researching and reporting on the calamities and triumphs of those unique and noble souls who, whether through deed or action, were transformed by the Catholic culture into Martyrs.<br>   <dd>   After completing one full circle of the calendar, I see that I retread the same soil and stories as last year. I have no wish to become hackneyed and pedestrian, to be an echo of the year before or a foreshadow of columns to come. This realization and the advice of a good editor lead me to revamp my weekly distraction into something more akin to a travel guide, a martyrlogue, per se. It is in this way that I can present new and useful information and keep my idea of a weekly reminder of suffering and miracles alive. I hope you will join me in marrying the two ideas together when we begin a new pilgrimage next week, until then...<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/mow.html"> Other Martyr of the Week Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
