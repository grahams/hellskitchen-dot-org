He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

(Kara and Christa are 2 American students that I've become good friends with here).  Our destination is Sozopol, a small town on the Black Sea coast.<br>    <dd>  We jump a train out of Blagoevgrad heading for Sofia, with three tickets through Sofia to Burgas (a big Black Sea Port). The train is late arriving at the Blagoevgrad platform, so we drink beers in the tired little station-cafe.  Dingy, pale green floor tiles covered with grime make sad sounds underfoot, and the checkered table cloths beg to have the crumbs shaken off and the grease washed out out of their fabric.  While lighting a smoke, I notice a young guy in the corner making ugly, leeringly suggestive faces at Kara.  I flash him the universal "Whaz up, Muthafucka?" sign of stabbing fingers spread before a cocked grimace of fury.  He looks away shyly and doesn't bother us any longer.  I feel very cavalier as we board the train to Sofia.<br>   <dd>   The ride to Sofia is uneventful, but we are brimming with excitement...we were all feeling quite dull hanging out in Blagoevgrad.  Our train hits Sofia at about 10PM and we pile out into a huge station house filled with backpackers, businessmen, beggars, Turks, and hitchikers.  The noise is deafening.  We wander around the terminal to find a great big ticker-board of trains, complete with big tiles that go "Clickitty-Klackitty-Click!" as they flip through announcements of trains going everywhere but the Albuquerque airport. After figuring out that we need to find track 4 we begin to wander around trying to decipher huge conflicting Cyrilic signs.  Then we run into a Bulgarian AUBG student who is seeing his brother, Martin, off to Burgas.  He says the train is overbooked and there are no seats, so apparently we'll have to stand.  What the hell.  It's only an 8 hour ride.  So with Martin in tow we blunder off to track 4.  We find the train and I spot a little snack stand down the platform and run off to buy a chocolate bar before departure.  It's almost 11PM.<br>    <dd>  At the stand I manage to make myself clear that I want a bar with almonds, Molya (please!).  As I get the bar, a birdish little voice at my elbow says "Excuse me sir, but could I please have a bite of your chocolate.  I've just fallen down stairs and I'm pain."  Eh? I turn to see a tiny young woman who looks malnourished and very shy. Her right eyelid is turning blue and over her eyebrow is a bandaid with blood seeping out from under it.   I turn to the stand and buy another chocolate bar.  She's overjoyed and thanks me with polite little nods while seeming too shy to hold eye-contact.<br>   <dd>   The train is beginning to roll forward and I jump on the nearest steps as it picks up speed.  I turn to see the young waif-girl jumping on a few cars back.  We all make camp in the cafe car, on a long counter-bar that runs through the middle of the car.  It's not really a cafe-car per se, more like a grey-yellow box with a fat, grumpy old man behind a burglar-bar counter selling sodas, peanuts, and warm beer. After a little conversation, Kara and I decide that the only way to survive 9 hours on our feet is to drink as much beer as possible. Christa and Martin stay sober and pledge to watch over us.  The beer's not too great, kinda like drinking warm Coors (maybe a little better...).<br> <dd>    Kara and I did our best to become silly-drunk, and I must admit it was a weak attempt once we were faced with downing liters of warm stale-flavored brew.  Chain-smoking our Melnik cigarettes, we start relating brave sexual tales.  Before long we all began telling dirty jokes and disrupting the car with our raucous laughter.  Martin did his best to translate Bulgarian jokes...but it generally left the three Americans staring at each other with bewilderment which led to mirth on realization that it was just a bad joke.  He did have one amusing joke, though:<br>      <dd>      A Bulgarian is bicycling through Sofia.  At the Bulgarian Communist Party Headquarters, he stops and leans his bike against the big granite building.  A party official leans out a window and yells, "Hey! Don't leave your bike there!!!  A Soviet delegation is coming for a big meeting!"  The man shakes his head and replies, "Don't worry!   I'm going to lock it up."<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
