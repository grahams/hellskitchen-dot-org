Due to the policy of mis-information pervasive in Eastern Europe at the time this issue was put together, we've decided to give you a first hand report of what's going on. <br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>November 26th, 1996<br>   <dd>  Suddenly things seem to be spinning out of control in Eastern Europe.  It's as if some wild mood of destruction has gripped the region. Yesterday 200,000 people demonstrated in Belgrade against the government controlled by Serbian strongman Milosevic.  Students were calling for his resignation, and I've heard rumors that portions of the crowd were tear-gassed by police units.  Meanwhile in Belarus (ex- Soviet republic), returns from a referendum seem to give total power to the extremist Pres. Lukashenka.  Apparently there are massive voting irregularities and my friend from Minsk is sure that the entire vote was rigged.  The parliament is moving to impeach him, and he has threatened to dissolve the government if parliament proceeds. Closer to home, Bulgaria is in severe economic crisis.<br>   <dd>   The Lev (Bulgarian currency) has collapsed.  In the space of a week, it's lost about 40% of it's value.  People suddenly look tense and worried when I watch them on the streets.  Though I empathize, I can't imagine what it would be like to wake up and find that the money you earned last week is worth 60% of what it used to be. Obviously, things are about to get very serious in Bulgaria.  Winter is almost here, and people are broke.  There's a grain shortage which makes bread more expensive than it would be normally.  Heating prices were hiked 20% in the last month.  The banks have collapsed (except for the state bank), and the gov't is in total disarray.<br> <dd>     The SDS (Union of Dem. Forces) holds the presidency and everyone wants the Communists (who hold Parliament) to call elections. Obviously, it'll be political suicide for them to do this, and the way things are looking, it'll be political suicide if they don't. I've heard rumors that money changers in Sofia are so swamped with business that they are selling the dollar at 400 or 450 leva, while the official rate is about 340.  Also, I've heard that there is a small amount of street looting and civil unrest.  The city police are undermanned to control any large scale riots.  The alternative would be to call in Army units, which are made up mostly of unhappy conscripts who probably wouldn't be thrilled about shooting other Bulgarians.<br>    <dd>  Bulgarians are at the end of their rope.  There is nothing more that they can do to alleviate their economic misery.  The rage that I assume they would feel towards their government and mafia for robbing and cajoling them must boil over at some point.  When people begin saying to themselves "What do I have to lose?", that's when governments and police forces have to be real scared.  Everyone knew that at some point there would be a massive devaluation, since the banks had made a lot of bad loans and the government was using foreign loans to pay state employees, etc.  But it's arrival is no less terrifying for the working class. Bulgaria probably wasn't ready for a switch to free markets, but there's not really any way for it to stop at this point.  I feel very sure that Bulgaria, along with Albania, is going to be the last part of Europe left in a 3rd world position.  Things are bad in Serbia, Macedonia, and Romania; but these countries all have massive natural resources.  Bulgaria has nothing to sell the world but wine, prostitution and drug smuggling routes.<br>   <dd>   It's not just fear that you can feel in the streets of Bulgaria: beneath it is a misery that people have felt since the first Turkish invasions.  The Balkans are used to hardship that is brought to them by dominant empires.  But they have never experienced such total national failures brought by their own governments.<br>   <dd>   Nothing for me to do here, just hold tight and keep my camera close.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
