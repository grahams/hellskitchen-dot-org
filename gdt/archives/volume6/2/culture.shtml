Their claim to fame is the 100% fatal kuru (which they exclusively are afflicted by), a degenerative neurological disease.  It is unique because the causative agent contains no nucleic acid; it is an infectious protein (prion).  The disease is transmitted through consumption of human brains (yummy... Now introducing at Taco Bell, the Kuru brain wrap, the perfect gift of revenge).  Annual deaths of kuru have dropped from 200 to about 10 after cannibalistic practices stopped around 1960.<br>   <dd>   As for social control, Fore women have a unique monopoly on marital power.  Husbands live in fear of their wives polluting them with their menstrual blood.  Imagine if American females had this same ability. Instead of hoarding cans of Mace and Pepper gas, women could carry around used tampons in a holster (tampon by day, wand of death by night).  In case of assault, just whip it out and use your best fencing moves.  And if that doesn't work, I hear the seven layer brain burrito doubles quite nicely as a shield.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/culture.html">Other Culture Kampfs in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/ma.html">Michele Amoruso</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
