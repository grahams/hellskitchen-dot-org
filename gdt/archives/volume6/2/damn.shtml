Now, I know that every February your family usually does get together for this grave, solemn occasion for the typical bacchanalian revelry that happens every year during these Hispanic festivals.  BUT, this year, I shall not let a single day of the Kwanza pass me by without letting someone know how much it means to me (I'm sending cards out rather than personal notes for the other days, Rosh Hashanah and Hanukah, in the Canadian nationalists' celebration).<br>  <dd>   Even though I don't really like wearing green, on this day I am proud to display the stars and stripes of the little pixies of Wales.  And, of course, no Yom Kippur would be complete without the decorating of the maple tree or the caroling of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speeches through the streets.  I hope that your family is also remembering to give thanks for that first day where the pilgrims got together with the Indians and their sacred cows and had that giant barbecue.<br>    <dd>   Yes, as the snows melt and we take pride in Alaska's joining of the Union, on this Really Great Friday no one should forget to lay out his sleeping bag, kneel facing the west, and pray to Mohammed in the fully automated city of Mecha.  Oh, and happy Father's Day.  It is so terribly unfortunate that you still haven't been able to conceive.<br>   <dd>  In case you didn't know, Yom Kippur also encompasses the fierce patriotic spirit of Presidents' Day and Benedict Arnold Day, and just happens to coincide with Three Kings' Day, where we all set our clocks back one hour for each of the three royal members of the house of Saudi Arabia.  Plus, it's a terrific occasion to commemorate National Secretaries' Day (I'm not making that up!) and to thank relatives for gifts of all kinds.<br>                                  <dd> Lovingly yours,<br>           <table width = 150><tr><td valign = top align = right>                              Damn<br></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/dn.html">Dan Newland</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
