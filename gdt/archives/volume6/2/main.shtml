Jack Frost is nibbling at my nips, the Salvation Army is whipping their bellboys into shape, and suicides, not so coincidentally, are skyrocketing. Must be Christmas time! December 25th is the one time of the year when people around the world put aside their petty differences and come together in a spending frenzy (like a feeding frenzy, only more blood).<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images2/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    It wasn't always like this. Long, long ago, in a distant galaxy...whoops, wrong story -when Jews were building pyramids and Rome was getting it's ass kicked by the Celts, the Living God was being a nebby-nose in the area of the Middle East. I'm not talking about Jesus and his jolly band of ex-fishermen and whores. No! I'm talking about that other Living God. You know, the one that was as well admired as cleavage in Hollywood. He was thriving in the Roman Empire 200 years before Christianity rode in on His coat tails.<br>   <dd>  Mithra started out as a major minor deity of Zoroastrism (It's sort of like being the star player on the local dairy company's softball team, or like being the manager of a 7-11). You may remember the Zoroastrians for bringing us such joys as "The Modern Zodiac," the word "Magician",<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> and providing cool names for books that go "bing!"     With so much Mithranic liturgy and symbolism hinged upon the Iranian culture's deep dependence on zodiac symbols and meaning, not to mention their astounding good taste in clothing, much of the moving drama of Mithra has been reduced to non-sensical innuendo. Nevertheless, I'll try to outline some of the high points.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Symbolized as a trinity (bringer of light and life, the emblem of cold and death, and the ever-present invincible God), Mithra was the God of the sun, often symbolized as a coiled snake. As the protector of truth, antagonist of falsehood and error, and bane of Ahriman (a supremely evil entity in the Zoroastrian etherical melodrama, kind of like Pat Robertson, but with better dress sense), Mithra was the mediator between the unapproachable and unknowable God and the masses of humans huddled in fear on the globe listening to Tony Bennett and Mel Torme on 8-tracks. Well, it was a very long time ago!<br>   <dd>  As a sun god, it's only natural that his day of celebration would be the winter solstice. Held on December 25th, it represented His return after the cold, dead winter. Curiouser and curiouser.<br>  <dd>   Mithra's birth is subject to some interesting scrutiny, as well. He was born from a rock that became known as the Rock of Generation. As he emerged from his igneous womb, shepherds heralded his arrival and offered the divine infant the first fruits of their flock and harvest. Oddly enough, there were no humans or many plants, or even a whole heck of a lot of animals at the time. There were, however, a plethora of mushrooms, slippers, and an old red sweater. Where the red sweater got the idea that there were people mucking about is the subject of a great deal of theosophical debate. It seems that all sweaters are sentient beings, but lack any sort of linear time reference. That is totally beyond the point of this article, and in hindsight, this whole portion should have been banished to a footnote.<br><dd>   As Mithra grew older, he undertook a series of Herculean labors at the request of Heaven, one of which was the capture of the only animal in the world at that time: a large bull. After chasing the beast into exhaustion, Mithra bound the creature and dragged it across a road strewn with obstacles. It might sound silly to us, but His journey with the bound bull was known as the Painful Journey, <I>Transitus</I>. For the faithful, it became a symbol of human suffering. Like we need another....<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images2/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    In time, the bull escaped and Heaven ordered Mithra to slay the beast. Although Mithra did not wish to, he sacrificed the creature. From the corpse, all animals, plants, and life sprang forth. Like the Hindus and many other Indo-Iranian peoples, time was considered a subjective concept and the bull was a powerful symbol of...well, bull. It was the first animal domesticated and symbolized a great deal.  It was food, cheaper labor, and made a great idol. In slaying the bull, Mithra made the ultimate sacrifice in the eyes of His worshippers; one that allowed death to bring forth new life that was richer and more fecund than the old.<br>    <dd> With his tasks finished, Mithra and his companions celebrated in a Last Supper, after which they ascended to Heaven. The entire ritual of the last supper was recreated by the faithful for those confirmed in the faith during their masses. Little is known of the Mithric communion, mainly due to the systematic destruction of all Mithric temples and literature.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#167;</A></a> The only remnants are in the form of Christian commentary that makes it clear that the pagan Mithrans used bread and wine in their service.<br> <dd>    After his retirement in the eternal salvation, it was said He would return. The <I>Avesta</I> (Zoroastrian holy book) said that semen from Zaratust would be kept safe from demons by preserving it in Lake Kasava and protected by 9,999 spirits of righteousness (They couldn't have found just one more). At the end of the proscribed time for the earth, the virgin Eredat-fedhri, would be bathing in the lake and would conceive. Her child would be the Savior, Saoshyant (i.e., Mithra in human form).<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images2/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    In those end days, Mithra will awaken the dead and judge them. For a job like that you really do need a god; it's not as if you can nudge a corpse long enough and it will come back to life just to smack you. He will slaughter a another sacred bull (New and improved Sacred Bull-- Now comes with Stain Guard!) and, using fat from the sacrifice, will consecrate wine and bestow immortality to the just. Ahriman and all the evil in the world would then be devoured by a divine fire from Heaven and the chosen would spend eternity playing cribbage and drinking prune juice. Forever.  "Saoshyant with his helpers shall restore the world, which henceforth will never grow old and die, never decay and never rot, ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, and the dead will rise [like yeast?], when life and immortality will come, and the world will be restored at its wish."<br>   <dd>  With so many similarities, it is not surprising that Christianity quickly gained a hold in the Roman Empire. Only after Constantine was converted was the power of the Mithric mystery cults totally destroyed by roving bands of Christians. Knowing their enemies, they would slaughter the Magi in their temples, thus rendering the temples unfit for worship, making a holy ruckus, and spoiling a damn good afternoon.<br>  <dd>   So when Santa is getting ready to squeeze his fat tuckus down your  chimney and you're chugging your 'nog, give a few moments of thought to Mithra.<br>  <dd>   Merry Mithramas.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> "Hi, I'm Troy McClure, you may remember me from such religious documentaries as, `Watch your step, there's a god down there,' `Heaven, nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there,' and `Venus...Cool.'
