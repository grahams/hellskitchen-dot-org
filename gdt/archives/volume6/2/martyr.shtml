This week we look at <B>St. Andrew</B> (for those who like to cook, his <B>Feast Day is November 30</B>). St. Andrew is the Patron of Scotland, Greece, Russia, fishermen, sailors and spinsters. He is invoked against gout and neck problems.<br>   <dd> Andrew was a fisherman who, along with his brother,Peter, became one of the original disciples of Jesus. Andrew was present for both Christ's Passion and Crucifixion. He traveled and preached widely and is said to be responsible for the evangelization of Greece and Asia Minor. It was there, in Achaia, that our saint was martyred; he was crucified on an X shaped cross for baptizing the local Roman governor's wife.<p>     <B> Travel Plans:</B> To visit St. Andrew's, a town on the East coast of Scotland named after and containing a pre-reformation shrine to our saint that once housed his relics, travel to either Edinburgh (and go north) or Dundee (and go south). St. Andrew's relics (minus the head) are now housed in the town of Amalfi in Southern Italy. The head (stolen centuries earlier by Crusaders) was returned to Istanbul (not Constantinople) in 1972 by Pope Paul VI, where it still resides.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
