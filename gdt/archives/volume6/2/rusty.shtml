He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.   Feel free to email him at CPL960@JMC.AUBG.BG <br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><dd>    As the evening wears on I watch the weary mix of people around me.  There's middle class businessmen reading Cyrillic newspapers and porno-novels.  When ever we all burst into laugher or start shouting at each other in English, they peer over the papers suspiciously.  A group of three Gypsies crouch by an open window passing a bottle of Raquia (a very strong Bulgarian fruit-liquor), and pausing to grin at our laughter or spit out the window.  I watch their brown, wrinkled faces and field-scarred hands as they share cigarettes and mumble to one another in heavily accented Bulgarian.  Old women in brown babushkas shuffle past scowling this way and that, looking for an empty corner to sleep in.  Later, the girl with the bruised face comes to stand with us and smile shyly at our jokes.  Her name is Virginia (hardly a common Bulgarian name!), her mother is an English teacher, and she wants very badly to study in the US.  We reassure her that she will.  She says she ate the entire chocolate bar immediately. As I watch her, I see the thin anemic skin and the grey circles under her eyes.  Her limbs are all terribly thin.  I wonder if she has an eating disorder.  (Apparently this is a big problem for Bulgarian young women, the sudden explosion of Western media here having left them feeling incredibly deficient in the face of the elegant super-models on TV and in the magazines.)<br>   <dd>   Virginia wants to see our ID's, drivers licenceses, passports, and snapshots.  She marvels over them and asks shyly if she can show them to her mother.  She runs off and soon returns toting her own Bulgarian ID and several snapshots of her graduation party and her new dress that she wore.  I am struck by the preciousness that photographs have for Bulgarians. (I have observed this behavior several times now, sometimes having to page through great stacks of snapshots in order to be polite.)  The photos are invariably unexciting.  But they seem to hold an incredible value to Bulgarians as fetishes (or tokens) of personal identity and connection to society, family, and love interest.<br>   <dd>   Sometime after 3AM, I stick my head out of the window to blow smoke into the wind and notice that we have left the mountainous terrain of inner Bulgaria and are crossing the huge expanse of the Danube flood-plain (This plain spreads out for hundreds of miles North and South of the last 200 miles or so of the Danube.  It is some of the richest farmland of both Bulgaria and Romania.).  By the light of the almost-full moon, it seems that we could be crossing South Dakota...wheat and corn fields stretch out forever in all directions.  I smile into the wind and the smoky voice of Kerouc rolls a great jazz tale of moonlit fields seen from train windows across my mind as I think of my own wild-hearted adventure.<br>    <dd>  At a small stop (a concrete pad, 2 streetlights and a tiny ticket shack)  somewhere in this huge agrarian nocturne, we notice a few seats open up in the next car.  We get to sit for the last few hours of our journey.  I doze a little, but am too excited to really sleep.<p> Friday 8/29/96--<br>   <dd>  At 6:30, I see the creeping light of dawn through the windows and lean out to have a look.  We're heading along the edge of the great C-shaped Bay of Burgas.  The view deserves the bracing pain of an early morning smoke.  The skyline is held by great rusting freight-cranes, who lean over little blue-grey freight cars to snatch colorless loads and deliver them to the great slug-like freight ships that seem to hover in the thick, oily water.  It is the cold, grinning, caterpillar dawn of the wreck of industrialism.  Even the first rays of sun seem to be stained by grease and oil smoke. Everywhere are great refinery tubes and pipes, crawling up to burned-grey towers burning their hideous smoking flames.  I feel like I've rolled onto the set of some gloomy no-future sci-fi movie.  At the station we stumble wearily onto the concrete pad and try to avoid getting run over by a train-car load of hollering kids arriving for summer camp who spill like a grinning blond river around us.  Martin points out the buses heading for Sozopol, then leaves to visit his mother's house.<br>   <dd>   We decide to find coffee and breakfast before getting on another moving vehicle.  At the little sidewalk non-stop (what bulgarians call  24hr cafes) we sip espresso (the only coffee Bulgarians drink  -- they claim that Americans drink coffee-flavored water) and eat chewy chocolate croissants.  Suddenly a swarm of mosquitos descend upon us and bite Kara repeatedly.  Finally we are forced to leave the cafe in a rush to escape being eaten alive.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
