And how better to do it than add their own peculiar column. The Great Big Student and the Itty-Bitty Student thought it was a capital idea, whereas the Fuzzy-Headed Medium Height One thought they were off their rockers. Regardless, the three wrote their very first column and sent it off to the <I>Reporter </I> to be scrutinized. Looked at, that is. Examined. Jello Journalism.<br>  <dd>   Their column was denied on the grounds that the content was reprehensible, even if it was funny. The three students moped about for a couple of weeks until one day the Fuzzy-Headed One pointed out that they could print it themselves. A publication was born.<br>   <dd>   Initially the whole thing was merely a diversion with a circulation of sixty. They didn't really figure that they would be doing it for very long until the fateful day when they received their first hate mail. Ah, Volume 4 issue 4. How I doth love thee. Ironically enough this was their fourth issue, then they stopped fucking about with the designations and made everything into Volume 1. By the end of the year they had gathered so much support from the faculty and students at the school that they were able to get a grant to do this stuff; they even managed to pick up a few more staff members.<br>  <dd>   As their first issue anniversary fast approached, the Great Big Student had already said his fond farewells, the Little Publication that Could realized that as the Itty-Bitty Student and the Fuzzy-Headed Student would eventually be graduating, they couldn't possibly continue doing this sort of thing from beyond the grave, could they? The publication's biological clock was ticking, it was time to have a child.<br>    <dd>  By now you must realize that this little fairy tale story is about the birth of <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>. Well, three children and a first-cousin (and let me tell you, she makes me wish I were more like Poe. Ohhhh, the recessive mutations...) later, GDT is still around and hasn't lost her girlish figure. With the birth of <I>Melancholy Predator</I>, <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>, <I>Cereal</I>, and coming soon to a publication near you, the <I>Iconoclast</I>, I guess you could say with so many offspring that GDT is a mommy...and not a one of them really suckled her dugs.<br> <dd>    As part of our constant attempt to stay in shape, all the publications of Hell's Kitchen will be undergoing a tuck here, a nip there. We'd love to hear what you think of our (soon to appear) new publications and any changes to your old favorites so we can live...<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG  width=500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images3/edit.gif"><br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
