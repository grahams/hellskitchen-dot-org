The impending fall of the centuries has always been a tense time for those of Christian persuasion, what with the ever present promises of the return of Jesus and His Homies. The passing of the millennium, however, is making more than the usual number of Pascal-Christians<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#131;</A></a> a bit nervous. Seems everywhere I look, I see wild-eyed, horse-faced women feverishly clutching their rosary beads to their bosoms (ok, not everywhere, usually just the ones I'm stalking). Can you blame them? Look around you, buddy! The end is nigh! Apathy, Famine, Pestilence...all the Apocalypse Boys are loitering about, just itching for a rumble.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images3/1.1.gif"><br> <dd>    History's greatest prophets are even backing up John's fungus-induced Revelations;<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, George the Goitered Garageman...they all enigmatically point to the crossover from 1999 to 2000 as a time of strife and unrest. No rest for the wicked, I guess.<br>   <dd>  With the Rapture practically huffing and puffing, and demanding to be let in (not by the hairs on my chinny-chin chin!), there are no delusions in my mind that when Gabriel blows his divine alto kazoo, and all the true believers (i.e. Christians) are taken up into Heaven (unless the kids from kingdom hall are correct and heaven only has space alotted for 200,000), I will be left behind to revel in the Tribulation. Unfortunately, a lot of others will be left behind, too. According to the 1993 World Almanac there are 1,783,660,000 Christians in the world. Assuming that every professed Christian leaves this mortal coil in the Rapture, that leaves just about four billion people left on the planet. With most of the Christians nestled in Europe and the Americas, the sudden disappearance of two billion people would reduce it to vast tracts of unsettled land open for Asia, African, and Middle Eastern colonialism.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images3/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>  All in all, the Rapture and following Age of Tribulation is sounding pretty good. Unfortunately,  the dregs of humanity would have to come to terms with the greatest existential crisis ever. Think Gen-Xers are apathetic? Imagine what things will be like after the leftovers learn that 1) There is a God and 2) They just missed the literal soul train.<br> <dd>    As civilization slowly grinds to a halt, carried forward on inertia alone, there I'll be, in the vast Heartland of the now desolate North American continent, camera in hand.<br>  <dd>   Wandering from area to area, searching for those left behind, I plan on creating a photo-journal called "After the Rapture." Employing stark black and white images styled after those taken during the Great Depression, the journal will show the slow death of a people's soul, and perhaps the birth of something greater. You see, with the Great Divine Tourist having come and left us behind in the Dark, we can stop hiding our hatred for His leaving us the first time. As the newly fumigated regions are resettled, humanity will have a chance to do it right, leaving God out of the picture for the first time. No more theological arguments by design. God exists: Venerat, viderat, relinquerat. He left us, not necessarily because we were bad, but because we weren't wearing the right team colors. A new Age of Reason, the Tribulation, rising from the remnants of two thousand years of Sky-Father worship, like the Phoenix of legend. If the human remnants realize that their holy ship had sailed, they could finally get on with the business of living. Humanity would be able to storm Olympus with our flaming flashlights as Zeus once feared, scattering a junk mail trail of Ed McMahon and Ames fliers behind us.<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>     Already there are a number of publishing companies (after all, they'll still be here, too) interested in my proposal, and I've received some rather substantial offers. Although I can't discuss the details of the impending contract, I can tell you that the sum in question can buy more Silly-String and glow-in-the-dark chalk than even I can imagine.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#131;</A> Pascal had a wonderfully practical outlook on religion. He reasoned that if there is a God in Heaven, and you went to Church every week, you were bound to weasel your way in. If upon your death you find there's nothing to find (i.e. you no longer exist), then you had simply wasted some of your time while alive, and that it wouldn't matter to you at that point anyway.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A> John the Apostle received the visions for Revelations while shipwrecked in the Mediterranean.
