When the King arranged for his buddy to become the Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry's plans backfired on him. Instead of being a pushover, Thomas took his position very seriously and began opposing his former friend on many issues concerning the separation of Church and State.<br>    <dd> Some soldiers overheard the King complaining of his problems with our saint, and they took it upon themselves to rid their monarch of this thorn in his side (is that crown?). They brutally murdered Thomas in Canterbury cathedral in 1170. The Pope was appalled at the kind of message that this sent and ensured that Thomas was canonized within three years. The shrine built to him in Canterbury cathedral was for centuries one of the premier pilgrimage sites in England (It's the destination of the travelers in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales).<p><B>Travel:</B> To Canterbury,England. Canterbury is located in Southeastern England in Kent. It is easily accessible from London.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
