He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

The design is supposed to be more faulty than Chernobyl.   Two soldiers and their girlfriends ham it up and laugh together a few seats away.  They are beautiful in their swaggering pride, and I begin sneaking photos of them.  After a while they notice and seem to enjoy it.  About 15 minutes into the ride , Kara begins to itch everywhere and complains that her cotton tee-shirt feels like scratchy wool.  Within another 10 min. or so, it's obvious that she is having a full blown allergy attack. Great red welts appear on her arms and legs, and her face turns puffy with large red blotches.  She scratches maniacally and I try to calm her down, telling her that everything is going to be fine, and to just concentrate on not scratching herself.  She clasps her hands tightly and stares straight ahead with gritting teeth.<br>   <dd>   We arrive in Sozopol, which is a far cry more beautiful than the industrial wreck of Burgas.  As we stand at the bus station trying to figure out where to go to find a doctor, we fumble in our guide books and are accosted by an asiatic woman who wants to put us up in her boarding house.  After much confusion she tells us that she has a woman staying with her who speaks English and can help us find a doctor for Kara.  We wander up through narrow cobblestone streets bordered by beautiful old stone and wood-carved houses.  I try to get as much of a look around as possible while reassuring Kara, even though she is beginning to look really bad.  At the boarding house, which is set over a kitschy looking restaurant with thatched straw umbrellas, we find the English-speaking woman from Sophia.  After a little explanation she suggests giving Kara some anti-histimine tablets before finding a doctor.  Even though Kara is lying on a bed panting, it seems like a reasonable idea. 10 minutes after taking the pills she seems almost cured.  In the meantime Christa and I check out the room, etc. and decide that it's a great find for the price (about $7 1/2 for all three of us per night.)  We take naps to recover from our journey.<br>  <dd>    Later, showered and excited, we wander down into the idyllic streets of Sozopol.  The town is built on a small rocky peninsula that juts in a curved finger, about 1/2 a mile out into the Black Sea.  It was originally one of the first ancient Greek settlements on the Black Sea, in about 700 BC.  Later, it was an important military and trade post for the Roman empire, the Byzantine empire, the Ottoman Empire, and finally it was one of the last Ottoman towns to fall to the Bulgarians in the Balkan Slavic wars of the 20th century.  In the modern day it is populated by a mix of ethnic Greeks and Bulgarians and is known to be the beach resort for those who prefer quiet cobblestone streets to Beach-side high-rise casinos.  We ate clam salads and olives in a small restaurant, then headed for the beach.<br>    <dd>  The beach was populated with hordes of beautiful, barely-clad women who made it extremely difficult to concentrate on something like, say... walking.  Bulgarians are as hip to topless swimming as the French are.  There were more women going topless than not.  The crowd of people seemed to mostly be locals, judging by their incredible Florida-grade tans.  The beach had almost-surfable waves, and the water was clear, clean and refreshingly cool.  I jumped in and swam about 50 meters from the shore to realize that I was being pulled out to sea by a hideously strong undertow.  I worked for a solid 10 minutes to get back in to shore.  About the point where I could just touch my toes in the sand, a young boy, maybe 6, came floundering over a wave, flapping his arms and crying in Russian.  He was powerless in the undertow and looked like he had already swallowed a lot of water.  I swam over to him and towed him into shore.   The lifeguards were too busy flirting with their girlfriends to notice me doing their job for them. Likely he would have drowned if I hadn't happened to be there at that moment.<br>    <dd>  After a long day of sunbathing and dozing, we retired to the hotel. As we were wandering out in twilight trying to decide what to do with ourselves, we ran into a guy we had talked to on the train...a Bulgarian named Loubeko.  After stumbling over his name several times, we Christened him "Lou".  He was a quiet-faced, dark-skinned guy who studied Philosophy in Sofia.  We had a great time hanging out with him.  We eventually ended up in a small cafe, drinking wonderful dry Bulgarian white wine and talking with a table full of Poles.  (The Bulgarian coast is still predominately touristed by Eastern Europeans, although it seems to be attracting a fair amount of middle-class English and Germans these days.)  After much fun, we exchanged addresses and they urged me to come visit them in Krakow.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
