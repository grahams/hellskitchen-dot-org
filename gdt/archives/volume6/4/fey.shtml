While there, in one of those moments when I wasn't braving the frigid Maine air to journey across ill-kept fields where the trees and brambles were slowly winning the battle against the cows, or using my brother's trampoline and dreaming of flight, my parents offered to treat me to a movie. After driving 22 miles to the first Lowes Theatre to be built in the state's capital, Augusta, we decided to see Michael.<br>  <dd>   Stop here. This is not a movie review. As much as I, as an editor of GDT, would like to have a weekly column dealing with movies or TV (No music. 'Zines focus on music and I refuse to let GDT be a ' zine. We're too literate for that). Suffice it to say that the movie was entertaining. The thing I'd like to focus on here in my little faerie ring (gather closer, friends, lest you fall from the dance) is the lead character's personality.<br>   <dd>  Michael the Archangel; Chief of the Angels; angel of repentance, righteousness, mercy, and satisfaction; conqueror of Satan; and if we believe the movie, wooer of women, searcher of fun, and He Who Acts Like A Spoiled Child.<br>  <dd>   In short, not angelic at all.<br>  <dd>   He was demanding, manipulative, insistent on getting his way (in one scene, causing a car to get a flat tire so he could see "The World's Largest Frying Pan"), and partaking in sexual intercourse outside of wedlock. Hmmm, sounds positively Faerie-like to me.<br> <dd>    At one point halfway through the film, even my mother whispered, "He acts like a faerie." Yes, mom, he does. Maybe there's not so big a difference between Faeries and Angels as is thought. Angels, aliens, faeries...they could be simply the same manifestation seen from different cultural points of view. Culture is an amazing filter, bending and filtering the Multiverse until what we see is not what is really there, but what we expect to see. And with entities that may cloth themselves in our expectations, that effect would be compounded.<br>  <dd>   Next week: Part one of the Invasion Cycle of the Irish.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
