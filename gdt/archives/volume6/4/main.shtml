Sensually, the acolyte inserts them into the centrally located slots and selects the deity of choice. After a hesitant moment, the vestibule issues forth the cylinder of refreshment, descending like a sperm whale's nightmare from the hidden mechanisms within. Its painted surface reflects the ambient lighting and the Pepsi can's trademarked "Uh-Huh" beckons....</I><br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images4/1.1.gif"><br> <dd>    Contrary to popular, and logical, conceptions, words can be owned. "Uh-Huh" is the trademark of Pepsi, thanks to Ray Charles and his evil triumvirate of sexy swingers. If Pepsi can trademark "Uh-Huh," then the N-double-A-CP should be able to trademark undesirable words like, oh..."nigger" and collect royalties on them. Imagine it: thousands of Mini Arcana Farces being put through college based on the race hatred of others.<br> <dd>    While we're on the topic of less-than-perfect worlds (like England), in the land of chips n' crumpets there once lived a squinty, shrew-like transvestite named Mrs. Niggerbaiter.  Granted, she only "lived" for a few minutes in a Monty Python sketch, but the impetus behind her creation was driven by more than just a goofy bunch of cross-dressers. Working with Jungian archetypes, the geniuses of Monty Python drew upon our collective unconscious and revealed the quintessential question of our existence that mankind has tried to explain through mythology, religion and science:  What is niggerbaiting?<br><dd>  At this point, you might not be ready to start screaming, "RACIST SCHWEIN-HUND!" Please wait, it gets better. Sure, we could do some obvious things that involve seeded melons and fried avians, but they are trite and not worth mentioning.  Seasoned hunters<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> know that it is important to pick an area where they are sure to catch their prey. It is obvious that one will catch more beavers in a swamp than on the side of Mt. Kilimanjaro. We suggest setting up your Clever Acme<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> Nigger-Trap&#153; in the forlorn, desolate areas of modern cities (where large vehicles use gunshots instead of beeps to indicate they are backing up) and leaving a "My First Crack-Pipe Kit" (now with optional pacifier-adapter for crack babies) in the middle of the street.  If you're not sure where to acquire your kit, call your local CIA affiliate. Motto:  We Deliver for You.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images4/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Of course, the obvious problem is that of selection. In addition to your desired prey, you are bound to attract the attention of White Trash&trade; and countless Latinos. Besides, you don't want the poor souls who keep trying to freebase all the baking soda and diatomaceous earth they can get their shaking hands upon. Biotechnologists run into a similar problem when screening for specific bacteria (shaking hands, that is). It comes down to using the right selective media. May we suggest television?  Set your Crack-Pipe Kit on top of a Samsung playing a tape of "Def Comedy Jam,"  the show where comedians dare not tell an actual joke for fear of being stoned to death by the crowd.  One "Def" monologue went exactly like this:<br>   <dd>   "Remember that toothpaste you used to use..."<br> <dd>    (Some giggles)<br>  <dd>   "...when you were a kid?"<br>   <dd>  (Uproarious laughter)<br>  <dd>    "And those cars you used to have?"<br>   <dd>  (Guffaws, hooting, mild incontinence)<br> <dd>    Other races won't be able to get anywhere near the bait.  They'll try, of course, first dropping to their knees and trying to crawl under the vocal barrage. After their ears start to bleed, dragging themselves ever so much closer to your bait, they'll finally burst into flames.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images4/1.3.gif"><br>    <dd>  So by now you may be taken aback by all the racial slurs floating around this article like radon in our homes. I don't really take issue with the double standard that it's acceptable for black people to call other Africans "nigger" while white people instantly become "The Man" if they use the N-word.  What I don't get is why the President, for instance, doesn't call up, for example...the Director of the FBI and say, "Hey, honky!  How's the surveillance going on that cracker Bill Gates?"  Why don't I ever hear a student in my class say, "Prof. Whitebread, I have a question."  When someone misses a class and asks a friend what they missed, why don't they ever say, "Yeah, the Man said the paper is due next Friday."<br>   <dd>  And since we are kind of on the subject here, why is there only one Hispanic D.J. on the radio?  I'm not talking about just 88.5 and 90.1 on your FM dial.  I mean everywhere I've heard Latin music (not the Gregorian chant kind, silly), there's the same guy saying something like "&#191;Donde est&#225; el cuarto de ba&#241;o? T&#250; est&#225;s un maric&#243;n bendejo puto.  Tu madre tiene un pito de caballo. &#191;C&#243;mo est&#225;s su familia? &#191;Quieres comer desayuno en la restaurante conmigo? &#161;Nosotros estamos limpiando hijos pocitos chochos ahora a Johnson's Supermarket!"  He and the white bitch whom you talk to every time you use voice mail or automated touch tone answering systems have the biggest monopoly on the face of the earth.  And it'll keep going, too, because they don't employ children in sweatshops or lock cats in little boxes (can't tell if they're dead, can ya?); the federal government ( a.k.a. "The Man") won't shut them down.  How do I know?  Because she is also the "Computer" on Star Trek!  Today, the phone lines, tomorrow, the Federation!<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Mrs. Dash is one of the more ferocious big game hunters.
