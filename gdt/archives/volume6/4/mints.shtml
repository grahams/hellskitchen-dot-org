James Burke. If anyone deserves to be elevated to the level of False Idol, it's Him. Those who regularly watch the Learning Channel (all five of us) or read Scientific American probably know who I'm talking about. The man is a wealth of historical, scientific, and cultural minute. In the various series created by Him that run on TLC and in His columns that periodically appear in Scientific American, he excels at connecting apparently isolated, absurd events:<p><UL><LI>How grapefruit directly led to WWII<LI>How an obscure inventor's "Wheelbarrow on a tightrope" trick lets battle ships shoot down jets in stormy seas.<LI>How thermometers were spared the embarrassment of being heretical because Galileo insisted, "But it does move."</UL><p>  <dd>   Often I've lamented that I lack His sheer width and breadth of knowledge. Don't get me wrong: I know a lot of useless crap, but I'd be embarrassed to even look at the guy.<br>   <dd>  What I do want is to have Him on a leash. Oh, happy day! While women are walking Great Danes that are used for more than protection (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), I'd have grey-haired, balding-on-top James Burke on the end of one of those retractable leashes.<br> <dd>    The best part is that when other dogs harass my Burke, I could cry the dreaded, "Connect!" Woe onto they who are subjected to the endless diatribe that would, eventually, connect all the things in the Universe and answer The Ultimate Question (No. The answer is not 42. You're one of those people who can quote the entire Holy Grail, aren't you? Aren't you?!) and drive any moderately sentient being mad.<br>  <dd>   Thank all that is good, i.e. James Burke, that He understands, "Heel!"<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/mints.html">Other After Dinner Mints in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
