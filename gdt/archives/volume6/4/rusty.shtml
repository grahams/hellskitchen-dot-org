He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.   Feel free to email him at CPL960@JMC.AUBG.BG <br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>  <dd> We slept late, and spent much of the day wandering around checking out all the interesting hand-crafted wares street vendors were selling. A new throng of vendors seem to have descended on the town; we later found out that they were coming for the Apollonia festival--a ten day swing of music, drama, and art shows.  We split up...I spent some time swimming from black rocks on the point of the peninsula, and some time sitting in a greek restaurant nursing a beer and writing romantic things to Silvia, my Italian sweetheart.  We all met Lou again that evening and did more talking and wandering...ending up at a beach-side disco where Kara, Lou and I danced until 4 AM, then went to a "non-stop" (24-hr cafe) with friends we made in the disco.  At 6, Lou, a gorgeous Bulgarian girl named Anni, and I all walked to the beach to watch the sun boil up out of the Black Sea.<br>  <dd>    Before I've thought about it, I am embracing Anni, lost in soft kisses, and the curves of her barely-18 body pressed against me. It is the irony of fate that keeps me faithful to Sylvia, as there is no place to be private, and I am to leave the town within an hour.<br>   <dd>  I return to our room at 8AM to wake the girls, trying to keep my shame for kissing Anni under my skin. By 9 AM we were headed back to Burgas, then on to Sofia on a train that arrived 2 hours late.  On the train I was treated to another of the snap shot sessions by Bulgarians riding in our compartment.  We left Burgas without buying any water bottles to take with us.  It was a hot, sweltering day on the Danube plains, and within three hours of leaving Burgas we had to find the cafe-car to buy water.  It was on the far side of the over-crowded train...when we finally struggled through the halls packed with sad-faced people trying to act like they were comfortable, we were greeted by another grumpy old guy in the cafe car.  "Ne Voda! Biera e Wodka!" he shouted at us.  No water.  Beer and Vodka only. It was an ugly long trip.<br>   <dd>   In Sofia we found that we had missed the last train leaving to Blagoevgrad, and had to take a train headed to a small town about 30 km from Blagoevgrad, hoping to find a bus or taxi.<br> <dd>     As soon as we left Sophia, dusk fell and it began to rain like a Bible story.  Along the way to Doupnitsa we fell into a hilarious conversation with a conductor named Andre.  When he realized our plight, he offered to take us to Blagoevgrad if we would buy petrol for his car.  (Gasoline is hideously expensive for Bulgarians...it runs about $2.25 a gallon...and the average Bulgarian makes about $70 to $100 a month.)  We obliged and had a great time getting home. Back in Blagoevgrad, we found that we'd missed a whole weekend of rain.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
