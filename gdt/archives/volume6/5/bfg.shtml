Rivers are very old creatures, some of the oldest on the planet, however because it's been some time since their youth, they aren't so in tune with some of these new fangled concepts such as a spherical planet.<br> <dd>     When the rivers were young, or even middle-aged, it was still largely believed that the globe was in fact flat. As many people might recall, a majority of maps are recorded such that the north is always indicated to be pointing in an upwards direction, while the south is considered to be pointing downward. Rivers, being quite impressionable believe that this means they should be flowing in more or less the same direction whether it be downhill or down map, gravity being as inescapable as it is. The Nile is an exception as it flows through the valley of the kings, more then anything it wants to be noticed and how better to be noticed than to go against the current (so to speak). In every way this river has shown itself to be an unruly and haughty river, much too good to do as all the other rivers.<br>   <dd>  Now if you were to look at a relatively accurate depiction of the globe, you might be struck by the fact that a fair number of rivers (ie. a majority) seem to be going in either an eastern or western direction rather than south as stated in the question. Do not let this trivial physical manifestation of evidence dissuade you from the true heart of the matter. All these visually meandering creatures are actually under the impression that they are going south. A vast proportion of the rivers have either gone senile over the years and no longer remember which direction is south, or they are much to obstinate to ask directions and thus perpetually meander. This is most evident in the fact that the younger rivers, with their faster flowing waters cut relatively straight paths in the Earth's surface, while the older, slower rivers tend to oxbow and get stuck in sand bars, often becoming nostalgic and gurgling to themselves about the good old days (you know turning to blood, that sort of thing).<br><table><tr><td width = 100 align = top></td><td width = 150 valign = top>-The Bare-Foot Girl<br></td></tr></table></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
