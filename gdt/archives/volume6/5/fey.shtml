One of the earliest GDT advertisements read, "GDT: Because we have way too much free time." Not so anymore. Between spending the last couple days working on "Cadence" because the illustrator backed out at the last minute, doing lay-out for GDT, attending night after night of rehearsal for Much Ado About Nothing, and working full-time, I'm a tired little boy. It's 3:12 AM, Thursday morning, and I am just now able to start this column. No one but me has had the opportunity to read this column prior to going to the printers. Any spelling or grammar errors, are therefore entirely my fault.<br>   <dd>  That having been said, let me talk about the Irish a bit.<br>    <dd>  In recent years, the fantasy genera has been deluged with novels, excellent and questionable, pulling on lore form the British Isles. Rightly so. Even today, the islands and moors are peopled by individuals who still sing smooring songs and follow the old ways concerning the Good Folk.<br>    <dd>  Though thoroughly Christianized, much of Ireland has retained many of its traditions concerning their peculiar brand of faerie. Before they can be spoken of, however, it helps to know some history as recounted by The Book of Invasions.<br>  <dd>   Prior to Christianity and writing, The Book of Invasions was, undoubtedly, an oral tale. Only after St. Patrick would it have been set to print. Christian influence is plainly seen, for the earliest settlers of Ireland are recorded to be the descendants of Noah. Comprised of fifty-one women and three men, all but one man, Fintan, perished in the Flood by changing himself first into a salmon, then an eagle, and finally a hawk. His survival allowed the tale of his people to be passed onto the island's next settlers.<p><B>Next week: continuation of The Book of Invasions.</B><br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG   SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><br><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
