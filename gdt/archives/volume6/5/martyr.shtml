This appointment was opposed by a number of people, including St. Bernard of Clairvaux, due to suspicions of simony (a bribe or payoff made in order to receive an appointed ecclesiastical position).William's enemies didn't rest until he was deposed from his bishopric. He went into retirement as a monk in Winchester and was a model of patience and resignation.He was ultimately restored to his position at York and received a hero's return from his congregation. He died, it is rumored of poisoning, almost immediately. William is interred in York Cathedral<p><B>Travel:</B>To the city of York, England. York is located in Northeastern England and is easily accessible from Leeds.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
