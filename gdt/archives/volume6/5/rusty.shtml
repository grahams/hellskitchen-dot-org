The Leva (Bulgarian currency) continues its freefall (it's now worth 1/3 of what it was when I arrived in August), and strikes and protests are being held daily in every large town in the country, often paralyzing industries, schools, and public utilities.<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images5/rusty2.gif"><br><table><tr><td width = 5></td><td width = 240 valign = top><B>A Zajedno protestor waves the Serbian flag during a night rally.

Within a few days of the first anti-government demonstrations, students had set up a complex organizational body that resembled a parliament, engineered the en-masse boycott of classes, and secured funds for food and the manufacture of propaganda. Arriving at the Philosophy building (which has become the heart of the student movement), I was questioned by "Student Security" (all access to the building is limited to students and journalists). In classrooms where lectures would have been going on, chain-smoking students were planning protests and designing propaganda posters. I was briefed in the student Press Center by idealistic young students with excellent English. The entire student movement has extraodinary media savvy: protest acts and propaganda are designed for maximum media impact. Placards and banners are often in English, and their slogans, like "Belgrade is the World" are catchy and powerful.<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top>	<IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images5/rusty1.gif"><br><table><tr><td width = 5></td><td width = 240 valign = top><B>Behind the lines of the riot police during the Dec. 24th riot.

The spectre of 'D.B.' (state security) looms in everyone's mind. After hearing several rumors of  shadowy secret police activities, I spoke to a young women who had had an "informative conversation" with two plain-clothed agents who took her to an empty apartment and told her the names of everyone she worked with and that it would be unfortunate if any of them "got into trouble." Another second-hand story told of a similar interview in which a student was played a tape from a meeting he participated in. The students expect that the university buildings are bugged, and often preface meetings with a group shout of, "Hello, D.B.!!!"<br>   <dd>  Posters lining city walls and leaflets scattered on sidewalks make the ongoing protests a tangible presence everywhere. Buying roasted chestnuts on the street, I was surprised to find that they were served on a student protest news leaflet. Everywhere in the city, people can be seen wearing anti-government buttons and colorful whistles which are used to raise a great roar during demonstrations. On the edge of Terazje square, rock music and pre-recorded fiery speeches blast along all day from speakers in the third story office of the Democratic Party, which is part of the Zajedno opposition coalition. The students and the coalition supporters are both demanding that the government revoke its dismissal of local elections in which Zajedno was widely victorious.<br>  <dd>  Two independent newspapers and an independent radio station provide the citizens of Belgrade with news that is more objective than the state-controlled media channels. But people in smaller towns and rural areas across Serbia are being informed by state-run media that the huge 50,000 to 300,000 people demonstrating daily in Belgrade are actually "small bands of rabble rousers" who are being fed Exstacy pills and paid $300 a day by Western governments to disrupt daily life in the city. During my six day visit, the students' portrayal of the rural Serbs (who make up the bulk of Communist support) changed from "misinformed farmers" to "manipulated peasants." A defining element of the current power struggle is the battle which is raging for the minds of Serbians. The struggle to distribute information and thereby portray the opposite party highlights what has become a war of theatrical drama on the streets as well in the media.<br> <dd>    On December 22nd, news of a large pro-government rally was leaked to one of Belgrade's independent radio stations. The demonstration was to take place on Terazje square, at the same time a Zajedno protest would be occurring there. "This means that December 24th will be the first day of a civil war," Marta Gligorijevic told me after her meeting with her co-captains of student security. On the 24th, a huge fleet of buses arrived in Belgrade carrying at least 75,000 workers from the countryside who had been given free transportation and a day of paid leave to come to the pro-government rally. Most of them did not realize what was really happening in Belgrade and believed they were being given a day off from work by the gracious President Milosevic. Clearly what was being organized was a riot that would justify the use of force by the huge contingent of riot police waiting on the outskirts of the city (estimates put their number at 50,000).<br>  <dd>   The pro-government protesters arrived to find a huge, angry mob of about 200,000 people waiting for them on Terazje square. The melee that ensued was simply horrifying. Men of all ages beat each other with sticks while the air was thick with eggs, fruit, and rocks thrown by both parties. Old women sat on the sidewalks and wept. While they tried to scrape egg from their clothes, young women hurled vicious jeers at them. I kept low and tried to photograph, but still took a glancing blow on the head from an airborne rock. When the anti-government mob threatened to destroy the cinema lights and cameras that had been set up for the rally, riot police arrived wielding clubs and shields to clear the anti-government mob from the square. Tear gas was used, and at least two people were killed and scores injured.<br>   <dd>  In Bulgaria, protests against the Communist-controlled Parliament began on Jan. 7th. Having succeeded in destroying what's left of Bulgaria's economy, the deputies then tried to postpone elections as long as possible. Students at the University of Sofia have been boycotting classes to lead the opposition protest, which is demanding immediate elections. On Dec. 10th the protests turned violent when the protesters encircled the Parliament and refused to let the deputies leave. That night, a group of protesters broke into through a riot police cordon, entered the Parliament building and set it on fire.  Riot police used tear gas and badly beat at least 100 protesters.<br>   <dd>  Much to my chagrin, all this happened while I was stranded in Greece. But I have since attended the marches, and felt the nervously excited mood of my Bulgarian friends. As I said before, Bulgarians are at the end of their rope, and even the most drastic improvement in politics will not improve their economic woes. A few days ago, a Bulgarian friend confided to me that his monthly salary was about $25.  The cost of a loaf of bread has risen to almost 50 cents, and beggars now commonly try their luck outside bakeries, sometimes with young babies on their hips.<br>  <dd>   I worry all the time about the friends I've made all over the Balkans. To struggle against governments who oppress and bankrupt your people is a beautiful and honorable deed, but things could get real "hot" at any time now. It's spooky. But it's damn nice to see the bastards fry in their own fat. <br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top>	<IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images5/rusty3.gif"><br><table><tr><td width = 5></td><td width = 240 valign = top><B>Late on Dec. 24th, riot police withdrew from downtown Belgrade.
