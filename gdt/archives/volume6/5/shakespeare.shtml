They have to finance themselves and appeal to the general public, while also maintaining some aesthetic standards. Playwrights and designers hanker after their own theatres, where they can develop and establish artistic identities. They would also like to perform specially for wealthy folks who have estates with large empty rooms (the republican equivalent of royalty), but it is no longer very fashionable.  They have to be wary of moralizing politicians who might squash their grant support, and they have to worry about offending various groups with their choice of plays or playing styles. They have to compete for audiences with other forms of recreation and entertainment, some of which are indistinguishable from prostitution. Their equivalent of English foul weather and plague is the American obligation to justify their work as socially worthwhile-as if it were self-evidently inferior to things like engineering and investment counselling.<br>   <dd>  This commercial theatre model is out of place in our non-profit educational institutions, where play production should be part of an experimental process of learning how theatre works and what its cultural use is.  At the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), this learning process is steadily taking shape as a collaboration among students and faculty from several separate colleges and programs. The productions of the two-year-old drama club, RIT Players, now enjoy support from the College of Liberal Arts' specially designated fund for fine arts performance. The first steps have been taken to fashion a multi-disciplinary course around an annual production of a work of performing art. And there is a renewed impetus to combine the performance resources of National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) and other schools of RIT in cooperative productions. There are still obstacles. RIT Players does not yet have its own rehearsal, storage, or performance space; nor are its theatre productions accorded priority claim to any campus performance facility or equipment. And, of course, it must compete for its local audience with several established campus activities-parties and movies chief among them.<br>   <dd>  The progress of student theatre on campus and the continuing difficulties it faces define a challenging situation which must be met by a combination of resourcefulness, energy, and commitment.  This is what you will see in the current RIT Players' production of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, performed in the SAU Cafeteria (RIT), Shumway Commons (RIT), and Fireside Lounge (RIT), Thursday through Sunday, January 23 - 26, Thursday through Saturday, January 31 - February 1, and on Sunday, February 2, at Media Play in Southtown Plaza.<br><table><tr><td width = 20></td><td width = 230 valign = top>									       -Peter Ferran, College of Liberal Arts, RIT<br></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
