Their main methods of subsistence include gardening, foraging, and fishing.  As of 1982, about 450 Gebusi remained</I>.<p>   <dd>   The men and women prefer to sleep separately in communal longhouses, even after marriage.  It's quite similar to an episode of the Brady Bunch I saw over winter break.  Mike and the boys stayed in one tent while Alice, Carol, and the girls remained in a separate tent a few feet away.  The only difference is that the Gebusi don't have air mattresses or a picnic basket filled with Kentucky Fried Chicken.  But what they do have would make every Brady jealous.<p>  <B>Favorite Snacks:</B>  Protein-filled grubs, bird eggs, and nuts all supplement the otherwise starchy diet of the Gebusi.<p>  <B>Favorite Recipe:</B><br> <dd>1 Convicted sorcerer<br> <dd>Greens and sago to taste<p>  Butcher sorcerer.  Place in oven with greens and sago until medium-rare. Eat everything, with the exception of the intestines, which are to be discarded.<p> <B>Best Thing to do on a Saturday Night:</B>  Male initiation ceremonies which occur between the ages of 17 to 23 provide hours of entertainment.  In this rite of passage, boys must be orally inseminated by the older males in order to receive the essential male life force.  Manhood can only be attained through this ritualistic semen consumption (this type of ritual should be familiar to all you fraternity brothers).<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/culture.html">Other Culture Kampfs in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/ma.html">Michele Amoruso</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
