Much to my chagrin, I was told by her roommate that she was off, "Doing something for RIT."<br>  <dd>   Immediately, I felt bad because this meant she was waiting to be picked up. I explained that I was a part of the "thing for RIT" and that, if she wouldn't mind, I would like to speak with Michelle, so please go get her thank-you-very-much.<br>  <dd>   As I waited, I realized the importance of what I had heard. Despite our attempts to make students on the U of R feel that Hell's Kitchen is not a publication run by RIT students, we are still seen as interlopers. Granted, <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I>, the first seed crystal of Hell's Kitchen, began as publication put out by RIT students. That has changed. Of the fifteen staff members that currently make up GDT, seven of them are non-RIT students. Still we are an "RIT thing."<br> <dd>    Of course, it does not help that the U of R has established publications as <I>The Norm</I>. When GDT first began to print articles on the RIT campus, we did so in a vacuum. There were no other publications competing for that particular niche. In a short time, we did very well, and have even begun to compete with RIT's official newsmag, the <I>Reporter</I>. Quite well, I might add, if their pleas for writers to come and work for them is any indication.<br>  <dd>   I knew the situation would be different when trying to expand to the U of R. We only had one person from the U of R on the staff at that point, and would not be in a humor vacuum. Conditions would be very much be in the favor of the home team, aka The Norm. Although the combined yearly output of the publications that make up Hell's Kitchen buries that of The Norm (Hell's Kitchen produces approximately 350 pages of original material per year verses The Norm's 90), we do not seem to have won the support, trust, or readership that we had hoped to.<br>   <dd>   To help prove that Hell's Kitchen is committed to the University of Rochester, we hope to increase our printed presence on the campus, and actively recruit writers (attention Normites: feel free to contact us. We'd love to start working together). Because the U of R was on break while RIT was still holding classes, readers have missed some issues. With a prize of $75 going to the winner of the Literary Scavenger Hunt, we thought those literate enough to appreciate Hell's Kitchen would like the chance to have a level playing field. To that end, we are reprinting all of the questions asked thus far.<br>   <dd>  I hope that we hear from any readers from the University of Rochester. If nothing else, drop us a line letting us know that our issues are being read and not just thrown into the trash. And if we are being thrown into the trash, at least care enough to recycle. We do.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
