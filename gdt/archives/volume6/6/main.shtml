Currently, the most popular method is to build massive public aquariums and hope that tourists are willing to brave local war zones to look at mud-coloured native fish. Unfortunately, the indigenous population tends to get excited at seeing all the pretty fishies, and tries to shoot them with their little boomtwigs, usually without taking into account the refractive effects of the water.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a><br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images6/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    Ah, yes. Hand guns. Those slim, black slug throwers created solely to exterminate one's peers. Proponents of high velocity lead insist that hand guns are needed for protection...from other people with hand guns. Can you say, "circular logic?" Nevertheless, do-nothing local sheriffs from America's heartland are pushing the unconstitutionality of the Brady Bill. Why should good, hard-working, neurotic Americans have to wait two weeks to own a hand cannon while the local yokels do background checks? It's our Constitutional right to bear arms!<br>   <dd>  As Megalopolis<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> falls into ruin, the suburbs are flourishing. Refugees are fleeing from their houses to "safe zones" set up by the UN. Each year, usually in mid-summer, something amazing happens in these areas of respite: Renaissance Festivals.<IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>     With cries of "Huzzah!" and "Thou naughty varlet!" thousands of people across the country willingly pay economically unwarranted fees (While managing to put off visiting the "Fish of Lake Ontario" exhibit in Buffalo. Unfortunately, the only things to see are Zebra Mussels.) to see community actors act like asses, eat fatty, ill-cooked food, buy criminally-priced leather mugs, get insulted by "the rat catcher," and watch mock sword fights. Now there's an arm with style. Swords haven't been used as a realistic weapon for hundreds of years. Difficult to conceal, taking years to master, and ironically, illegal in the United States, fewer people are killed by swords in this fair nation than by stampeding chickens.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>    While the NRA continues to push for the repeal of handgun waiting periods, NASA (the National Association for Sword Advancement) has been working behind the scenes. By lobbying Congress, they are on the verge of solving all of America's problems.<br>  <dd>   By this time next year, all hand guns will be illegal. That's right. No more Saturday Night Specials. No more .22's. No more hollow-tipped, armor-piercing, uranium-depleted, teflon-coated, high-velocity slugs just itching to disintegrate some jack-booted thug's head.  Most pickup trucks will get weapon-rack overhauls, designed now to hold scabbards instead of shotguns.  Of course, there will be a period of transition where many will cling to their guns (Oh, it hurts), but with the government's proposed "Swords for Guns" program, it is expected that all over the country, gangs will be packing over three feet of sharpened steel. Imagine Akeem, wearing his size 40 jeans, feeling safe in the knowledge that he is concealing a rapier in its billowing folds, and his buddy Jacques (with his size 24 corduroys) by his side resting rather nervously, thinking about his sawed-off scimitar, all the time repeating, "Hey, Ak , what'rewegonnadotoday, huh? huh? What'rewegonnado?"<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images6/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    Then, the real magic begins. Crime-infested cities will transform into year-round Renaissance festivals. Good-bye, "Brown trout exhibit" and "Mississippi Snail Tank," adieu; no glory lies behind the back of such. Thousands of 'burbanites will flock to areas where "tourism" is a word that has no comparable translation into Ebonics. Local officials could charge exorbitant admission fees to enter their district of the city. There, families could stroll about eating fatty food by products, being insulted by the "fat man in a rocker," buying genuine rat-leather mugs, and watching real swashbuckling as rival gangs fight over turf.<br>     <dd>  Of course, their inexperience in sword play ("Tag! You're it!") will result in long, pitched battles, often ending when everyone is either exhausted from swinging steel about, or has broken his blade. This, fortunately, will lead to the re-creation of whole economies. Using abandoned cars, and forcing kidnapped Japanese exchange-students/sword-masters to disclose family secrets, gangs will begin their own blacksmithing, forging new swords and rediscovering the art of folding metal to create a blade capable of cutting through a shotgun barrel.<br> <dd>    But then, there won't be any shotguns, will there? They'll have to use a new unit of measure: <U>Hiiyah</U>- the SI unit of sword damage potential.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> The bottoms of aquariums in inner cities look just like the bottoms of the wading pools in malls, covered with small, flattened metal slugs.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#165;</A> Nine out of ten geographers can't be wrong.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#167;</A> The most recent chicken stampede occurred in Pispot, New Mexico.
