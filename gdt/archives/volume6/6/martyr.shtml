Pancras is the patron of Children, Oaths and Treaties.<p>			<dd>St. Pancras was a 14 year old Syrian orphan who was martyred in Rome in 304. Pope Vitalian sent relics of our saint from the cemetery of Calepodius in Rometo, England. St.Augustine of Canterbury dedicated the first Church in England to St. Pancras, and subsequent churches throughout England are similarly named for him. You can visit the remains of the original church in Canterbury or stop at the St. Pancras railway station in London, built on the site of a now-demolished church.<p><B>Travel:</B> To Canterbury, England or London, England. Canterbury is located in Southeastern England in Kent. It is easily accessible from London. The St. Pancras station is located near both Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace in London.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
