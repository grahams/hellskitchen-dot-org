He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

My flight left Sofia at 11:20 AM. I planned to take the 6 AM train to Sofia, which would land me there by 9:30, with enough time to take a city bus to the airport.  Milano was almost in sight.<br>   <dd>   For my English class that evening, I showed the Bulgarians slides and asked them to talk about the images. Received all manner of comments. From the awed and mystical (on views of the Rocky Mountains) to disgusted and uncomfortable (on the famous photo of a Viet Cong's summary execution on the streets of Saigon). They loved it, going so far as to ask me to do another slide show for them. For homework, I told them to write an essay on Love due upon my return from amorous adventures. No doubt my excessively romantic mood dictated the subject. But they all seemed happy to write about it, especially the young women....<br>   <dd>   By 1 AM I was fed, packed, and totally unable to sleep. Why not have a drink...get back by 5, grab my bags, and head train station ways? Put on my nice pants and took my happy feet over to "Grafitti" (the only big disco in town). A big cavernous place painted black with too many black lights, weird modern-art-neon-cavemen on the walls, and bad American pop on the sound system. On Thursdays, the AUBG kids get in free and it's the great hopping night of faux-sexy grinds and too much drinking. Skirting the line of booth-tables on one wall, I found BISER sitting alone, nursing his vodka and emanating that audaciously unconscious cool. "Krees!" He shouted as I sat down. "Where are you days?" he slurs, meaning 'where've you been lately, dude?.' The great hulking puppydog of a man with greasy Balkan black hair always in a ponytail is the town's resident young-Turk artist, complete with his American girlfriend (my friend Kara, from Oregon), and his dawn to dusk drinking habits.  He took me to his studio a few weeks back to show me his almost abstract portraits of women in Fauvist colors with frantic, swirling movements. He's good, maybe the most forceful and powerful painter I've ever personally met...apparently an artist waiting to explode from the unknown shadows of the Balkans.<br> <dd>     Biser knocks down the last of his vodka, and we light cigarettes. "Kara go to Greece." he hollers at me.  I shake my head, Da. "Kara beautiful woman, I love her, maybe she not loving me.  Razbierash?" Yeah, yeah, I understand. I've had these conversations with Biser before, and experience shows that the only way to appreciate their nuances is to get as wacked as he is. At the bar, I buy a big double gin and a small vodka with a coke, Biser's usual. The girl behind the bar gets very upset that I don't have 10 leva to give her so she can avoid breaking my bigger notes. She waves the money at me, "Decet! Decet!"  Look lady, I just want a drink. All the Bulgarian bars keep a yellow squeeze bottle of factory lemon juice on the counter.  I've taken a liking to the cheap Bulgarian gin with a huge squeeze of the lemon juice.  Sitting down, I meet Biser's eyes and see that we're in this one for the better part of a hangover.  I'll sleep it off on the plane, I think. "Nasdraveh!" We smack our glasses together and keep mumbling to each other about Kara, women, and paintings. Every few sentences, the big lug wacks me on the knee and says, "I love you Krees!" I've found over the years that for some reason men need to say this to each other when they get really hammered.  I pat him on the shoulder and keep drinking.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
