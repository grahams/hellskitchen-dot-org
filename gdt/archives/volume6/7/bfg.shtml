Unfortunately that was not your question. But since I am a human of means, I shall answer your question.<br><dd>There were actually several really great things that existed in the world prior to sliced bread; I will only proceed to name the top three:<br>	<dd>3) Named as the "most ornithologically useless animal of all time," the Dodo bird. The Dodo was originally discovered by Portuguese sailors in 1507 on the island of Mauritius. It was described as being "...a stupid, fifty pound, roly-poly, flightless bird with a permanent silly expression on its face."(Stan Lee, <I>The Best of the World's Worst</I>. Los Angeles: General Publishing Group, Inc., 1994) There are only a couple of things that could possibly be better than a completely useless fowl, which explains why this is only in the third position.<br><dd>	2) Lot's wife. (i.e., the world's first salt lick.)<br><dd>	1) The Tick. Granted, he's a little more contemporary than the others, but he did go back in time to help a clan of early ancestors. Although they did have croutons and freshly ground pepper for their salads, I didn't notice any sliced bread.<br>	<dd>	-The Bare-Foot Girl</multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
