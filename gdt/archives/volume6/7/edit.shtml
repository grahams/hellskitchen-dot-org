He had spoken with several people who found the article&hellip;hurtful. Indeed it was a little tinderbox, just waiting to spurn a fire. On our side, we had at least attempted to spread the flames around a bit by talking about many different groups and not just one. But this faculty member informed me, as I had heard from other sources, that this article had hit the African-American crowd particularly hard.<br>   <dd>   Good. That particular article was so loaded with racist material that I was surprised we didn't have a mob attempting to hunt down the editors. Instead, those objecting to our content exercised their Constitutional rights to suppress our Constitution rights by throwing issues into the non-recyclable trash ("Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"). Oh well...<br>    <dd>  When I was much younger, I knew several members of the local White Supremacist Skinheads, as well as Racial Unity Skinheads (I might have known several members of the local Nazi Skinhead Group, but my best friend was Jewish, and the fact that they were trying to kill her sort of strained any possible relations with them). In my association with the two groups, I noticed some interesting correlation's: they both thought there was something wrong with their lives and they desperately wanted someone to take it out on&hellip;someone to blame. I remember listening to one of the white supremacists I knew talk about his beliefs. He said that it had been scientifically proven that blacks were missing something in their brains, that they were genetically inferior. I had grown up in a family of scientists and I knew that the party line he had committed to rote memory was made up of as many lies as the uber-whites could construct. Their rhetoric was created to instill a sense of control. Sure, their lives were bad now, but at least they knew who they could blame. Their rhetoric was only given power because of their fears. As long as there is a scapegoat, you don't have to accept that you are responsible for your own life.<br>   <dd>   In addition to the fear-mongering white supremacists, I had also encountered the counter-version. When I was in middle-school my best friend braided up my hair in hundreds of tiny little braids and, while walking through the halls at school, one of the older black girls started threatening me, saying that, as a <I>white</I> girl, I had no right to wear my hair in that style. Years passed and I watched as children who had played together, not caring what color they were, no longer spoke with each other. Some of the African-American students had become angry at the injustices dealt them and began to blame all whites, not just the ones that were involved.<br>    <dd>   There is a double standard that has evolved. I remember hearing a boy say at one point that the word discrimination only included the injustices of whites against blacks, that it couldn't possibly be considered the injustices of blacks against whites. I learned from one of my friends, whose father was black and mother was white, that those in the middle receive the short end of both sides. There is race and gender hatred on all sides, and that must be acknowledged before we get anywhere. These types of "White pride" and "Black pride" are the same phenomena, they just perpetuate the problem and both are undesirable.<br>   <dd>   In the two short years that <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> has been publishing, we have covered a diverse range of topics, many of them controversial. We have openly encouraged cannibalism, and suicide (in no less than three articles), implied that the Holocaust was a sort of karmic justice for genocide the Israelites committed against the peoples already living in the Holy Land prior to their invasion, and in the issue published a few weeks prior to "Race-Baiting" (GDT Volume 6, issue 1), we implied that humans were overpopulated and should be thinned a bit utilizing the methods currently used to control deer herds: Baiting and shooting. In that article, we graphically described the luring of a white hick named Jolene and her inevitable murder at the hands of a hunter.<br>    <dd>  We upset some African-Americans when we published "Race Baiting?" Where was their anger when we published "Bait and Shoot?" Same concept, different races. You see, we set you up.<br>   <dd>  And you fell for it.<br>   <dd>   GDT was once accused of taking the attitude of, "It's funny because it's not me." Not so. It's funny even when it is us. If you don't believe me, then read past issues where we make fun of ourselves. It is our readers who get offended when the topics we choose get a little too close to home. Luring stupid whites to their death with cars placed on blocks? Oh, that's funny. Luring stupid blacks with crack pipes and Def Comedy Jam (and we didn't even kill them!)? All of a sudden we're racist.<br>   <dd>   As long as there are people basing their behavior on absurd tribal loyalties (real or imagined), GDT will have a wealth of material. You want equality? Well, in GDT you've got it. We'll treat every form of absurdity we encounter the same. That's what we're all about. Absurdity. Racism is absurd. Denying individuals civil and intellectual rights is absurd. Denying personal freedom is absurd. Every form of hate and denial of life is absurd. Absurd actions are...well, absurd! If you can't laugh in the face of absurdity, then you've missed the point of the whole game. And if you can't play the game well, can I buy Baltic Ave. from you?<br>    <dd>  You should already know what you are capable of as a human being. You know what respect you deserve in the eyes of others. Do not sit around and ask them for the respect you so rightly deserve; they will never hand it over under those terms. Show them how worthy you are of their regard with your actions. Prove to them that they have no choice but to respect you as much as you respect yourself. If your sense of self or your allegiance to some group is so threatened by our attempts to bring the absurd into the spotlight, then something is wrong.<br>   <dd>   If anyone has anything they would like to say further on this matter, please contact us. Why people brought this issue up with faculty members is beyond me. We wrote it. We published it. Talk to us. We want to hear your voice. We want to hear everyone's voice because that means you're thinking! We are an open forum for anyone who chooses to take advantage of it.<br><font size=-1> <dd>-Kelly Gunter and Sean Hammond<br> <dd>GDT founders, editors, and writers<br></font size> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
