I could make excuses, but (Achtung! Reporter Staff) bad work is bad work and excuses don't fix things. I take full responsibility for all the stupid layout mistakes (like the last line of the Bare-foot Girl's column being cut off and the illegible white on black text for the Scavenger Hunt). And most of the spelling and grammar problems. What I don't take responsibility for is the apparent apathy of our readers. No one wrote us to say, "Hey Dumby! You screwed up!" It's no wonder the crap-filled Reporter (RIT's officially sanctioned Newsmag) is able to continue to print the mediocre material that is its mainstay (at best).<br>  <dd>   I'd like to say GDT won't fuck up again, but that would be a lie. Suffice it to say that us biologists, engineers, mathematicians, and anthropologists will continue to do the best job we can.<br><dd>  	-eds.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
