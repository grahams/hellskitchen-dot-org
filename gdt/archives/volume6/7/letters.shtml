I always enjoyed your goofiness, your wittiness, your wordiness, and everything else that ended in -ness, but lately it seems like the format has changed. Nowadays you guys are all...so damn serious! While I appreciate the sign of literate life on this campus, I miss your lighthearted, smartass commentaries on life, your quirky facts about the outside world we never see, and your completely random insanity.<br> <dd>What makes me bring this up is when I read the "Bare-Foot Girl" column in Vol. 6, Issue 5 (Jan. 26): her article about the direction of rivers. It was just so completely left-field; I loved it. It reminded me of the "incest" editorial you guys did last year, the one that had a footnote on time travel.<br> <dd>So you see, while I admire being poetic and artistic and expressive, columns like "Martyrlogue" and "Fey Denizen" (sorry to single you out, guys) have gotten way too serious lately. Hell's Kitchen in general has seemed to adopt a very dreary tone...it seems almost like an epitaph. Everything's got its place, and that includes corniness too.<br> <dd>Apologies all around if I sounded like a jerk. Thanx for listening, have a good day.<br>  			<dd>		Sincerely,<br> 					<dd>   "Joe Schmo"<p>Dear Joe Schmo,<br> <dd>    Way to make a girl feel all warm and mushy inside! Oh, wait... I am all warm and mushy inside (sans calcium deposits)! Actually, you're right. Our writing style has gotten a little dismal and dreary recently. I think this can be attributed in part to our over-worked head-editors. We've certainly lost a lot of steam since last year, and several active members. We still actively lament the passing of Troy into Metropolis, where he can no longer assist us with main articles. But we are pleased to be welcoming our most prized pupa, BJ Leopold back into our little fold.<br>  <dd>   All I can say is that you're right. We have lost sight of our fundamental principles, and if we could have a little assistance from our readerage, we can make GDT just as random and offending as it ever was. Please help the over-worked head-editors of GDT by sending in submissions, ideas, free food, and yourselves (slave labor).<br>  <dd>   In other words we could really use some assistance. We're at a point where we're not even sure where our illustrations will be coming from from week to week.<br>  	<dd>-Sincerely<br>	<dd>    Kelly Gunter<br>	  <dd>  Co-Head Editor<br> <dd>And just keep in mind that it's socially acceptable to talk to yourself in a public place, as long as you hold a cell phone.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
