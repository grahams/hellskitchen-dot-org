Most of these people have no foreseeable means of ever repaying those loans.  But, since you have to be in debt to have a good credit rating (or any credit rating), it's not uncommon to hear horror stories from people who could no longer make the payments on their 1978 Yugos<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> and found one morning, much to their surprise, that their piece-of-shit-mobile had been paid a visit from the Repo man and managed to start a war in the Balkan states.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> Part of the problem is the sheer lobbying power of the Repo Men's Union (RMU) to make the banks continue to give them contracts. Whenever the percentage of loans paid on time gets too high, the Yugos start to disappear again from unsuspecting driveways all over the suburbs of middle America.<br> <dd>That is only the first slip that sends young, successful burger-flippers straight to the bottom (not without the inevitable ka-chunk as their head smacks into the side of that dark, slime-covered shaft). Sooner or later you find yourself in a louse-infested room at the YMCA with your little gears sluggishly turning and you wonder, "Where did I go wrong? What next? They've taken my house, my car, my Skittles, all my worldly possessions, what more can they take? On the upside, I have four years of college under my belt, so I should be able to get a job somewhere. Right? Right!?"<br><dd>Well, now thanks to <A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a>Lethe Gee, a subsidiary of Hell Inc., the big bad Repo-man is coming for your college education. Haven't paid off those college loans yet? Thinking you had a little cushion zone since there was no way for you to default on your loan and you felt secure in the knowledge that your knowledge was secure? HA! Lethe Gee is on your tuckus, boys and girls. There's nowhere to run. The Gee-Men come not in the night like other RMU members, but in broad daylight when you are most likely to really need that Yugo to get home from the mall.  The age-old "Anybody remember where we parked?" routine quickly becomes the bitter taste of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride when the parking lot empties and there's nothing left but a few Tumble-Cans&trade; and the one obligatory tricycle playing hide and go seek with the empty shopping carts. As you dodge between race lanes of local frat brothers sailing by in the windy straits of the lot's many monocotyledonous curbside dividers (MCD's), you catch sight of the crushing blow: Lethe Gee's calling card. Yes, the Lethe Gee-Men do leave a calling card, so you know when you've been hit by the big boys (but only if you knew your ancient Greek mythology prior to taking out your college loans). When you see the larger-than-life parallelogram pink eraser<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a> where your spouse used to be, you begin to feel the edges of the hole left in your mind. You begin to realize that since you bought that car while attending college, you have no idea what it looks like.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images7/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Lethe Gee repossesses your education when you default on your college loans.  Because of the way humans learn, however, it's just too much trouble to remove the practical knowledge learned in classes without making the rest of the memories from that time of your life totally disjointed. Besides, most of the people who attend and/or graduate college don't care much for their book-learning, and so it loses all value as a bargaining chip; it's buried so deep under fuzzy recollections of beer funnels and gang-rapes (both giving and receiving) in the neighboring sorority house that most of them couldn't find it to answer a Jeopardy question with anyway, so who cares? To ensure the satisfaction of their client banks, Lethe Gee just takes the whole chunk. You literally lose four (or five or six) years of life, with only the summers and vacations left lingering, feeling utterly lost in the sea of fog that was your early adulthood.<br><dd>In theory, you could negotiate with your loan companies to try and get your memories returned if you began payments again. Unfortunately, most people don't remember that they have forgotten something and wander aimlessly around their old High School haunts, wondering where all their friends are.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images7/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>For those fortunate or observant enough to notice, the eraser left for them has a handy phone number to call: 1-800-LETHE-GE. The number is, of course, a front operation. When you call, even if they insist that they are a special delivering service for expecting mothers, be persistent. By all means give the operator your name and home address, but insist that you WANT to pay back your loans and could you please have your memories returned? Make it clear to them that you would be in a much better position to land a successful job if you could remember what exactly it was that you majored in. Best of luck, and remember the operators are Gee-men specially trained to keep up the facade.... Be persistent!<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> A Car Before its Time.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A>One of the (many) facts not released by the CIA concerning the latest BOOM from Europe's powderkeg is that the entire disintegration of Yugoslavia was not precipitated by cultural/religious tensions. The war was started because Serbia, thinking itself to be the Detroit of the Balkans, invested massive amounts of capital into their hope: the Yugo. Sadly, when worldwide sales fell far short of expectations, creditors insisted that debts be paid. Before Lethe Gee-men&167; (uhhh, headnote) appeared to collect as only they can, the country fell back upon the tried-and-true theory of the redistribution of wealth. They invaded neighboring areas to snatch up land and valuable silly-string resource rights, and paid off their debts.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#167;</A> This is not the footnote you're looking for. It was a headnote, silly, look up.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#164;</A> When Lethe Gee was only a few lonely men in the basement of the Hell Inc. world headquarters (when it exists corporeally), they considered the wedge-shaped pencil-tip erasers as their standard issue weapon of choice, but they chose the parallelogram style erasers because they are more ominous when pointed at a victim. And they hurt more when you get hit upside the head with them. Especially in rapid-fire mode when the teacher turns her back. <br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sp.html">Scott Peterson</A><br></td></tr></table>	<!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
