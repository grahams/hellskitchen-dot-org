He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

This spectacle is infinitely more entertaining when you add a guy drinking buckets of gin to the scene.  Somewhere after finishing my third glass, Biser and I begin taking great pleasure in throwing our glasses on the concrete floor after the last gulp.  The normal ass-watching and ugly-gesture-making follows soon afterwards.  Suddenly I'm full of energy and shaking it along with the best of what remains of the dancers.  After what is more than obviously the last dance, I return to the table to knock back the end of another gin and stumble out into the city park with Biser.  We manage to make our way to the all-night bakery that serves steamy-hot banitsas as they come out of the oven.<br>   <dd>   Like a scene from what you'd think a late night bakery in Communist country would be, this place is.  Three pudgy old women rolling out huge stretches of dough and chuckling through missing teeth at each other, while a great beer-gutted wonder of a man with a sweat-soaked tee-shirt tosses pans in and out of several huge, dusty ovens. There's no counter or register it's more like walking in the back door.  Most nights I have to shuffle my feet a few times before one of the old women looks up from greasing pastry pans.  On a good night my change is covered with greasy fingerprints and my banitsa is almost too hot to hold.  This is a good thing, as cold banitsa tastes like flour flavored cooking oil, whereas hot banitsa tastes like a cross between a croissant and a donut filled with feta cheese.<br>  <dd>    By the time we're almost done munching our breakfast while leaning on trees in the park, I realize that it's already 5:30 AM.  With a hurried farewell, I  stumble-run to the dorm and grab my bag and change my shirt.  Leaving the dormitory, I realize that I have about 20 minutes to run two kilometers with a huge bag of clothes and books.  Groggy and still-half drunk, I'm trying to figure out a better alternative as three beautiful young women run out of the dorm and ask me if I've seen their cab.  It arrives moments later, and I get to ride with them to the train station for a part of the fare.  Five minutes before I could have possibly made it to the platform, I'm rolling towards Sofia.  We all sit in the same compartment and I'm able to get a real look at these three freshmen.  All from Stara Zagora(a town in the North, close to the Danube, where Zagorka, the only well known Bulgarian beer, is made), they're heading home for break.  Deliana, the only very talkative one of them, is bleach-blonde (very popular here) with arching black eyebrows, light olive skin, and a 'devil-be-damned' smile.  As I drift into sleep a few minutes after we roll out of town, she's the only one who remains solidly in my mind.<br>   <dd>   Sofia is as gray and tired as ever.  I get in a taxi and tell the driver to take me to Orlov Most, a famous bridge where I can catch a bus to the airport.  The airport is 10 km from town and taxis won't take you there for less than $10 (from what I've heard).  Compared to a 20 cent bus ticket, I am willing to spend 4 times as long getting there.  The driver asks if I am going to the airport.  "I'll take you there, $10."  No, I'll take the bus.  A few blocks later, he offers again for $9.  By the time I can see Orlov Most, he's down to $5.  What the hell...that's worth it.  And off we go to the airport. Arriving at the international terminal (which sounds impressive, but is more like a huge warehouse with windows and a few Cyrillic signs), it's 10:05.  I realize to my total luck, that the travel agent wrote my ticket times wrong (they're still written by hand here) and that my plane is leaving at 10:20, rather than 11:20.<br>   <dd>   As the plane's nose edges up and that reassuring roar of wide open engines rolls around me, I smile a great self-satisfied smile. Luck is mine, and I am on a great hollow spear flung at the London of North Italy.  Soon there will be a tall yellow-haired girl to smile and kiss me in a new airport. And sleep rolls over me like a great warm weight.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
