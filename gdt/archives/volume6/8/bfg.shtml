I'm afraid, actually very afraid, that you are not the first person who has contacted me wishing to discuss our mutual roles in the "barefoot lifestyle." One guy even went so far as to send me a stack of pictures of his feet. I found this a little odd, but I guess to each his own. He kept asking me what I thought of them; I thought they were his feet.<br>    <dd>  Frankly, I don't know what the "barefoot lifestyle" is, and from the few interactions I have already had with other "barefooters" it seems kind of silly and perhaps obsessive. Just because I walk barefoot does not mean that I am a spiritual earthy sort of person, it does not mean I am a vegetarian (in fact I am a carnivore on moral grounds), it doesn't mean I take particularly good care of my feet or that I mentally control my body temperature, and it certainly doesn't make me capable of identifying whatever it is that is growing out of your little toe (sorry PJ).<br>  <dd>    I walk barefoot. It is not a political statement, nor a ploy to meet new and interesting people. I have no deep personal reason behind my choice to walk barefoot; it has been ten years now and I have gotten to the point where any injuries I may sustain walking barefoot are insubstantial compared with those I will sustain trying to wear shoes again. Walking barefoot is not something that defines me as an individual - it is just something that I do.<br>   <dd>   Actually, I wish that people would stop making a big deal about it. Seven years (not a mistake, for the first three years, no one cared. Just as I like it.) of listening to complete strangers ask inane questions starts to grate on your nerves after a time. As Christopher Lane says, "No shirt, no shoes, no karma." And that statement says about as much nothing on the matter as I really want to.<br>     <dd>      -The Barefoot Girl<br>     </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
