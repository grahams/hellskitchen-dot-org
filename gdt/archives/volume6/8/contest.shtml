For the next few weeks we will be printing a series of quotations from various literary sources. Some will be very well known, others less so. Each quote will have a point value associated with it, based on the difficulty of the question, in addition to periodic "Bonus Questions." The winner of the contest will be the person who gets the most points. The prize will be $75 dollars, and if the winner chooses, they may also become privy to the secrets of "Cafe Diablo," the most diabolical coffee in the world (and the official drink of Hell Inc.). The winner's name will be posted in the first issue of volume 7.  All answers must be sent to GDT by February 25th, 1997. GDT bids you good luck.<p> <dd><B> This Week's Hunt:</B><p>	22. (5 points)<br><dd> "This is what it is to be human: to see the essential existential futility of all action, all striving- and to act, to strive. This is what it is to be human: to reach forever beyond your grasp. This is what it is to be human: to live forever or die trying. This is what it is to be human: to perpetually ask the unanswerable questions, in the hope that the asking of them will somehow hasten the day when they will be answered. This is what it is to be human: to strive in the face of the certainty of failure.<br>	<dd>"This is what it is to be human: to persist.<br>	<dd>"For this is what it means to be human: to laugh at what another would call tragedy.<br>	<dd>"This is what it means to be human: to commit hara-kiri, with a smile if it becomes needful.
