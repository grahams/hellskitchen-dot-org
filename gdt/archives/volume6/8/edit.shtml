A few weeks ago a friend of mine commented that he was amazed at a particular issue of GDT because I had written the whole thing. I was a little surprised, because I distinctly remembered there being more pieces than what I wrote. Given, I've reached a point that all you have to do is stick a blank sheet of paper in front of me and I'll fill it and ask for-more-please, but GDT is definitely not mine alone.<br>  <dd>   Look under the list of staff members on page two (to the left dumby!). There, conspicuously appearing in an attractive font, complete with serifs, is the name "Kelly Gunter." It's not there merely for decoration. Kelly is just as active as I, though because of my boisterousness (I'm afraid that neighbors will never be able to say, "He was such a quiet boy...."), I am attributed as being the driving force behind GDT.<br>   <dd>  Well, not so naughty varlet! Kelly may be the quiet one, but it was her, and her alone, that started this puppy. She came up with the topic for our very first issue ("Ethiopian Fly-paper Boy," Volume 1, issue 1) and suggested that we begin printing our ideas on our own after the Reporter rejected our proposed weekly column. She's one arrogant bare-footed chick (oh yeah!).<br> <dD>    So, if you enjoy our work, or hate some topic we choose, blame her.<br> <dD>     Get off my back man! I'm "Little Hitler" and she's "the Bare-Foot Girl?" How's that fair?<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
