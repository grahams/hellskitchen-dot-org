I've been gone for a while, but I see you banked the fire and kept it smoldering. Drag some dry wood over. We'll get the flames higher.<br><dd>It's been so long since I started telling you about the Irish Book of Invasions as a means of introducing the Tuatha de Danaan that I might as well start over. Instead, a brief synopsis will have to suffice.<br><dd>The earliest invaders of the Emerald Isle consisted of fifty-one women and three men, all descendants of the Biblical Noah (insert St. Patrick's influence here). When the Deluge covered the globe, they all died with the exception of a mane named Fintan. To escape, he used his magick (a very un-christian ability) to transform himself into a salmon. Only once the waters started to recede did he become an eagle, hawk, and finally returned to human form.<br><dd>As Fintan spent his days alone, a new group of invaders arrived. Led by Partholon and his wife, Delgnat, the new-comers came from the west. In time, they met Fintan who passed his story on to them, lest it be lost.<br><dd>Soon after their arrival Partholon surveyed the island and ordered enough forests cleared to create three new plains and seven additional lakes made by diverting rivers. With all that hard work, it only made sense that they discovered how to brew ale. Ah, the Irish....<br><dd>During the rule of Partholon, he had the dubious honor of being embroiled in the island's first lawsuit. In that time, a dark race called the Formorians (sometimes considered a type of faerie) ranged over the country. Time and again, Partholon and his followers fought them off. Being gone so often his wife yearned for... companionship, and seduced a servant named Topa. Upon his discovery of this, Partholon charged her with adultery before his court. She countered that, with him gone so often, he had left her tantalizingly vulnerable. It was as though he had left his valuables out for any thief to fuck, I mean steal. Her infidelity was partly his fault and they must both share blame. In the end, she won her case.<br><dd>After many years of battling the Formorians, Partholon's people were wiped out. Not in battle, but by a plague. Only one man, Tuan, survived. Hiding in the mountains for twenty years to avoid the Formorians, he saw the landing of a new group: nine survivors from a great fleet that had floundered in the Atlantic.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG width = 500  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
