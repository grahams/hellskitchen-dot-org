Wide-eyed and out of breath, they pause next to the side of a dilapidated Walmart. Suddenly, a fist rings out, the hero falls to the ground, and an ominous figure stands silhouetted in the incandescent frenulum; a gloating figure, ready to deliver the death blow. But something stops the end move. The arch-villain stands transfixed. Slowly he lowers his hands to his hips and exhales deeply. The moment of hesitation is all that the hero needs, and he delivers the coup de grace. Startled, yet still inexplicably pleased with himself, the arch-villain, moving as if the world is now being played at twelve frames per second, caresses, sensually, this new-found orifice. His eyes track down until his gaze lights upon his crimson-kissed fingertips. Raising his sweat-streaked crown to meet the beguiling eyes of his childhood nemesis, his smile reaches auris ad auris, and his maniacal laugh seems deeper and more guttural than usual (perhaps a little gurgle-E). His immense mass careens in a downward trajectory towards terra firma, producing a satisfying sound akin to that of waxy, greasy, pink, sliced, processed meat by-products slapping against cold concrete. With his parting breath, the quickly fading villain leaves his final words to an uncaring and unknowing world:<br><dd>"Well, saaaayyyy...."<p></I><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images8/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Clitori. We all have them. "What about peni?" I hear the bright young lad in back ask ("Loops? Did you say Loops?" - Melancholy Predator's epitome of bad segue). Four out of five gynecologists agree that the only difference, the only scientific, medically-proven way to differentiate the two is that one gets much bigger than the other. One you can grab and the other you can only rub ("Oh genie of the clitoris!"). I mean, for that kind of difference, you need some serious blood migration. All in all, arousal in the typical male is a fairly cataclysmic event. Blood is diverted from other areas of the body just to pump that Bad-Boy&#153; up.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Ironically, when the human male goes for long periods of time without pitching a tent, the body may be pleased to be getting all the oxygen it needs, but the psyche becomes warped like an ill-prepared Shrinky-Dink (Oh, please. We wouldn't stoop so low as to use THAT bad of a pun. Yeah, we're way too cultured for that sort of nonsense).<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images8/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Researchers have gone through the trouble to waste valuable time and money to make connections between physical violence and impotence. Who's more violent than most? Why, super-villains of course! They might be cold and calculating, or lovably maniacal, but they all share the same thing: limp Willies (or Willmas, as the case may be).<br><dd>One of the least know facts concerning the worlds' varied supervillains is their inability to sustain a half-way respectable erection. The best most can manage is half-mast. The one time that nearly guarantees the fulfillment of their manhood is when they are doing mean things. Be it not holding a door open for an old woman or launching stolen nuclear weapons toward Liechtenstein, the perpetrators always, and I mean always, take a few moments to bask in the glory of their penis (or swollen clitoris if they happen to be a woman).<br><dd>Time and again villains' schemes are thwarted because they hesitate. They gloat. They share their plan. This isn't due to some character flaw that makes them cocky (again, we won't stoop to such obvious p-hey there's a penny down here!) or just a necessary way to allow the trapped hero to escape and eventually triumph. How much easier it would be if the villains would just kill the silly son of a bitch when he is sprawled out, weapons nowhere in sight, at the mercy of their bestial wrath. Instead, they stop. Why? Because they have a hard-on and are taking a moment from their very busy day to stop and smell the roses.<br><dd>Ah, to have an erection! To share in the simplest sexual activity that is man. For that all-too-brief moment, the super-villain feels human. Conversely, super-heros have the problems of perpetual hard-ons. Traipsing about in tights and jumping from building to building with the biting wind coursing across their compacted genitalia.<br> <dd>"Spoon!"<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images8/1.3.gif"><br><dd>With gobs of oxytocin (what scientists into studying sex technically refer to as the "cuddle chemical") screaming through their systems, superheros are in the unique position of being non-sexual and infinitely sexual. Think about it this way: if you ran about in a state of perpetual post-orgasmic bliss (PPOB, not to be confused with the PWU: the Postal Workers Union), how sexually active do you think you would be? Superheros have achieved a Zen-like state of sexual existence. All the satisfaction and half the contact.<br><dd>(insert Tick voice here)<br><dd>"There isn't much to say about superheros. They're big, they're buff, they've got boners, they're happy. All they really want in this world is to cuddle, and isn't that we all want, to cuddle with the world, like the big teddy bear that it is, sure it's got an eye missing and limbs torn off from time to time, but it's your teddy. So grab that teddy and cuddle for all you're worth!"<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Why men wish they had a larger penis is beyond me.
