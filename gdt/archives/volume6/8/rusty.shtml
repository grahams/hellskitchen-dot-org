He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

Cyril Methodius, I hoped that I didn't miss the bus I was supposed to catch at 8:45.  It was cold enough that I wished I was wearing longjohns under my Levis.  Ul. Cyril Methodius is a big boulevard that runs from the "Gara" (train and bus stations) past the University, and up into the hills at the edge of Blagoevgrad.  A week ago, I had given a lecture concerning cameras to the newly formed AUBG photo-club, "Focus."  They had received $600 from the school to outfit the club with cameras, and wanted to be able to get the most bang for their buck.  Although I was  nervous as hell about my first "lecture," I was doing my best to illustrate to them that they needed better cameras than a Taiwan "point and shoot" to take control of their photography.  Eventually, they decided that they would go to Sofia to look for cheap Russian 35mm manual bodies.  Having started them on this path, I could not refuse to come with them to check over the cameras, to see that they were functional.<br>    <dd>  The sky was hazy, and when I got to the station, the low morning sun was throwing soft, gold, slanting beams of light into the "Avto Gara" platform.  All good-sized Bulgarian train/bus stations have small "bazaars" or markets thrown up next to or nearby their platforms.  From dawn to midnight, old ladies peddle coffee, bananas, cold banitsa, soda, "sok" (isn't that a great word for juice?), newspapers, porno zines, plastic icons and sunflower seeds.  I was surveying the scene and noticing the industrial railyards towering behind the station when Tina and a few other Focus members arrived. After buying tickets, I took them back to my previous spot to point out the haloed backlighting that caught frosty breath so brilliantly, and the information-rich scene which spoke so fully about Bulgaria.  Having put in most of the organizational energy to start Focus, Tina was enthused.  With richly dark brown hair framing her ivory pale face, she is a typically beautiful Balkan woman (Romanian), and it was invigorating to watch excitement spread from her chocolate eyes to her flushed cheeks as she listened to the lesson.<br>    <dd>  All over Bulgaria, people tell me that the trains are much worse than the buses.  The trains are ugly and run down, they say.  They're always too slow.  The people who ride them are "distasteful."  With the exception of being slower (although cheaper to ride), I've found that there is, in fact, no difference between the conditions on trains in comparison to buses.  Conversely, the bus seats are much less comfortable, and of course, there are no bathrooms on the buses. And I always have better chances of an interesting conversation on a train.  Maybe I just prefer distasteful people.<br>   <dd>   As we pulled out of Blagoevgrad, I found that there was a possible discomfort on the buses which I'd never considered.  The exhaust of this particular bus was venting into the cabin.  Not in great quantity, but it was sufficiently stinky that I felt that it must be very unhealthy to breathe.  Opening a window, I caused a great cry of dismay from the passengers around me.  "It's too cold outside!" they insisted.  I couldn't believe that people would prefer to sit in exhaust fumes than to let in some cold air.  However, I seemed to be the only person on the bus troubled by the smell of half-burned gasoline.  Within 15 minutes of leaving town, the stench of the fumes was becoming a revolting fascination in my mind: I turned it over and over, and couldn't stop thinking of how to get some fresh air. Finally, I noticed a tiny draft coming from my window's seals, and spent the rest of the trip with my head leaned against the window, so that I could breathe unpolluted air.  The last 1/3 of the trip seems to take an excruciatingly huge amount of time. I kept thinking about the Bulgarian condemnation of the trains.<br>    <dd>  About half-way to Sofia, we passed a huge chemical manufacturing complex.  Held to ground level by the cold air, the thick brown haze that the factory was spewing caused visibility falloff at 200 meters, and total loss of sight within about 500 meters.  The stench of sulfur reached us, even through closed windows.  The fumes were settling heaviest  in a large 'dell,' or depression close to the plant.  A dozen or so ugly, gray, socialist-built concrete apartment buildings (which seem more like huge machine components than homes) were visible in the dell.  I had no doubt that they were for the plant's workers.  The vision of that place is my unrealized idea of "Hell on Earth."<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
