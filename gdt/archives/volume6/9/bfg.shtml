I<FONT SIZE =-1>T'S GOT TO HAPPEN SOME TIME, BUT ISN'T IT DANGEROUS</font size>?  <p>Michelle,<BR>   <dd>  I already gave you your answer, but I have to have something to write down for this week. So here it is...<br> <dd>    Not wanting to seem ungrateful to modern methods, a caesarean section would work. Some people, even developmentally stunted ones, want to give birth in a more natural way, though.<br>   <dd>   Actually, many midgets are sterile. I believe the correct terminology for this group is "dwarf." These are the ones with either big heads or big torsos, just something that doesn't proportionally work out quite right. However, the perfectly proportioned ones are still fertile...just tiny. Everything is smaller, but they can still give birth to normally sized children, which can be hell on a woman whose pelvis may be five or six inches smaller than the average. Come to think of it, it's usually not a party for a woman of average size, so it's got to be worse on those little women.<br>  <dd>   The solution is simple: crack. You know, that all-pervasive drug of the inner cities. Merely administer crack to pregnant midgets as you would calcium or other vitamins, internally stunting the growth of the soon to be crack-fetus. This way midget women can give birth the natural way to children with abnormally low birth weights. Sure they'll be born addicted to crack and they probably won't live past the first three months, but don't we all have quirky physical traits? Hey, if I can overcome freckles and thin hair, they can certainly overcome a debilitating physical addiction. It's called growing up.<br>    <dd>  It just goes to prove that there really are some socially redeeming qualities to crack. Crack... uh, natural way... uh, yeah. Whatever. I just have to go see about getting hair implants....<br>			<dd>	-BFG<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
