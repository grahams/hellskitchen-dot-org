Well, actually, it's Totowa, NJ with a twist.  One stretch of the road is exclusively occupied by midgets.  I was fascinated by this midget culture and I desperately wanted to learn more.  So, to further my education and in the interests of offending the administration, I decided to submit a study abroad proposal for anthropological study to the University of Rochester Study Abroad Office.<br>   <dd>  As part of my curriculum as an undergraduate anthropology student, I would like to take part in a self-designed study abroad program.  My proposal involves an ethnographic account of a small section of Totowa, NJ, commonly referred to as "Midget Town."  It consists of ten houses which are situated on what is best described as a residential jughandle.  The homeowners are exclusively midgets, voluntarily segregated from the rest of the community.  Their houses and front doors are scaled down to a more convenient size, as is evident in the photo essay.  I would like to live among the midgets for a single semester, and attempt an intensive ethnographic report of the inhabitants.<br>    <dd> Instead of choosing to focus on their deliberate attempt to separate themselves from society, I wish to examine the effects of consumerism on their small community.  My working title is "Consumption Practices Among Midgets in Totowa, NJ."  In such an environment, I could examine how the midgets have re-socialized their material environment.  What is unique to midgets in how objects are appropriated in order to become integrated with their species?<br>   <dd>   My research methods will initially include extensive interviews with all willing residents.  If permitted, I will thoroughly document the material possessions in the household and interview the owners in an attempt to extract a personal account of the importance and significance of various items.<br>  <dd>    My hope is to contribute to current consumption theory.  Permitting the midgets' approval, I will complete an ethnographic account of an American subculture.<br>  <dd>   Stay tuned, folks!<br><center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images9/culture.gif"><br><B> <dD> 1- For scale, note the height of the mailbox with respect to the top of the door.<br>  <dd>   2- For context, note that the large dark shape in the corner is part of the car the photo was taken from.
