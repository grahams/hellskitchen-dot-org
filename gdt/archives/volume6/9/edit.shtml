I just finished reading your editorial response to the "Race Baiting" article and I found it to be one of the most well-crafted, well-thought out, purely, and I mean PURELY, objective pieces of literature ever written by you guys. It stripped away all pretenses, it pulled no punches, it attacked all denial, it expressed the suppressed. Open-mindedness and simple, unbiased judgement like that usually disappears from people after age five...it's a rare and beautiful thing to be able to hold onto that kind of state mind.<br>    <dd>     That combined with the recent articles in GDT and MP have me thoroughly satisfied. I've never seen a publication so willing to take criticism and do something constructive with it. Keep up the good work!<br>                 <dd>				Yours in admiration,<br>                	<dD>				"Joe Schmo"<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
