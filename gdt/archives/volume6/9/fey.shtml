When I first started it, I had plenty of time. Then, due to numerous reasons, "Fey" did not run for a few weeks and I'm behind. If I'm asked nicely, maybe I'll consider revising the old columns into a large reprint. Anyway, here we go....</I><p>   <dd>  After Partholon's people were eradicated by a plague, leaving only Tuan to watch the towns and fields fall into disuse, a group of refuges arrived. Originally from a mighty fleet in the Atlantic, nine hundred and fifty-one people in thirty two boats died in storms, from disease, or starved. Finally the last ship and her crew of nine gratefully settled on the island.<br>  <dd>   Led by Nemed, they (like previous invaders) began by leaving their mark on the land, diverting rivers and cutting down forests. As in the time of Partholon, the malevolent Formorians roamed the land. To their credit, the Nemedians met them in four major battles over the centuries. In the fourth battle, however, the Nemedians were nearly wiped out. In the last battle, the Nemedians breached the fortress of one of the two Formorian Kings on the isle of Tory. One king was slain, but the other, using his rage and magick, slaughtered all but thirty Nemedians. One of the survivors, a man named Britan, settled on the island to the east. Others are said to have fled as far as Greece.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
