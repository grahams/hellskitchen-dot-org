Well, you're probably right. Look around you, Pablo: Walmart carries wood laminate furniture that it passes off as oak, people are giving themselves concrete enemas ("Ah...Marge, can I have a price check on concrete enemas?"), testicular torsion, cars dent too easily, 75 year old men dent too easily, papercuts, getting your hair caught in a threshing machine (yeah, that's a bitch), biting aluminum foil, getting your pantleg caught in a bicycle chain, squirrels (Q-FUCKING BOOM),<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> p-sublevels of lithium atoms, socks that lose their elasticity and fall down, sudden changes of temperature and humidity when you wear glasses, mosquitoes.... And we put up with all of it on a daily basis. It's only when things don't work that we realize how evil has crept into our lives like an appreciation for amateur Hammond Organ music and we cry out with a resounding, "God damn it!" or, "I feel TERRIBLE!"<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a><br><dd>    Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain. Jesus-fucking-Christ! What's wrong with you people anyway? Those silly little Israelites sure knew what they were talking about (Besides any group who passes on religion through the mitochondrial DNA is about as cool as you can get). Contrary to unpopular (at least with us) belief, God does exist and does stick his great big Jewish nose in our business...but only when we ask.<br>    <dd>  God is not a trinity as those fish scratchers would have you think. He is a divine dichotomy. He is the Alpha and the Omega, all and nothing. He is binary.<br> <IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images9/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    But.<br>  <dd>    Since he is a dichotomous omnipotent being, he can only respond to those of your needs that are translated into machine language. He is, after all, the Creator; who better qualified to use the most basic languages? Simple on/off requests only please, ma'am. If you ask God for something ridiculous like, "Please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change blah courage blah wisdom blah blah ra ba ba," all you're going to get is a "Processing...please wait" message for roughly the rest of your life. God's translators are written in Java, which as we all know, needs about four billion runtime libraries (read: Angels) to be processed. However, if you make your request to God in binary code, i.e. "God damn it!"<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a>  or "God bless you!", then you get a response, not only in your lifetime, but almost instantaneously.<br>     <dd>  Unfortunately, most of these effects are not noticeable, or at least not right away.  After thousands of years of people stubbing their toes and shouting "Godammit," he gets the idea and puts a standard-issue Damning&#153; on the event for all time. Same goes for papercuts, only they got the next level of damning, so they really Hurt-Like-A-Bitch.&#153; <br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images9/1.2.gif"><br><dd>     Sneezing, on the other hand, is about the most pleasurable thing you can do without involving your genitalia...which coincidentally also involves large amounts of god-blessing on the parts of most participants. In fact, sneezing (This is the reason why most people's sneezes seem to become louder and more earth shattering as a person grows older. God is under the mistaken opinion that bigger is better, and every time someone says "God bless you," it gets reinforced.) and sex are just about the only things left to us that have any kind of blessing on them at all, since so many people have been yelling "God damn it" on so many different objects and events, for millennia.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a><br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol6/images9/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    What's worse, people nowadays are in the habit of just sitting down after a long day and saying quietly, "God damn it," to nothing in particular. Given no specific target, God's unfortunate standard procedure is to send the command out to his randomizers (i.e. god's W.R.A.T.H<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a> ), which just adds to the over-all damnedness of today's world. It's another Be Careful What You Wish For situation, only it applies even if you didn't wish for anything in particular.<br>    <dd>  So keep screwing out there, folks, and don't forget to fulfill your required role when you hear someone sneeze, or we may lose our last bastion of pleasure.

God Bless Coffee Ice Cream! <br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> See GDT "Universe" Volume 4, Issue 8<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A> Page. 376 Amok Journal<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#167;</A> Ironically enough, there are various other smaller deities that deal with such commands as, "Fuck'n Fuck Fuck Fuck!", "Shit Ass Shit!", and of course "God Fucking Damn It!" Although this last phrase seems a lot like the binary code "God Damn It!", it is in fact a little too complex a statement for God and his chummies to figure out what to do with on a moment's notice. This particular phrase usually gets shifted to the department of Gomorrahic deities.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#131;</A> Things in eastern Europe might actually improve if people would stop referring to that whole region as "god-forsaken." And this also explains the general trend of the Reporter to go to shit while we have been steadily improving: most RIT students have been chanting "Godamnreporter" as a time honored mantra every Friday (especially when they don't put out an issue) and we've had the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship members praying for our souls since they first discovered we were climbing of our own free will into the proverbial handbasket.
