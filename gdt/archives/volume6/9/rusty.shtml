He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

Even completely packed with people, the tram's acrid, sweaty air seems fresh compared to the bus ride.  At every stop, people have to slither and shove their way out of the crowded tram, and a fresh batch of riders push themselves into the sardine can.  An old pensioner starts up with a harmonica close to me, and somehow the body-to-body proximity becomes a form of comradery in my mind. Getting out close to Alexander Nevsky cathedral, I see Sophia's beautiful old city for the first time.  Although the architecture and views aren't on the same plane as beautiful Western European cities, I realize that I had assumed that there was nothing endearing about the city.  It's the "new" city that is terrifyingly ugly.  I can't enunciate how horrifying and repulsive the mega-sized communist-era apartment high rises of Bulgaria are.  And Sophia seems to have the lion's share (huge stretches of nothing else) of these blighted structures.<br>   <dd>   Arriving at Nevsky Cathedral, I see my first monumental Orthodox church since my trip to Moscow 12 years ago (I don't remember my 2- year-old views of Istanbul's St. Sofia).  I didn't get a chance to take a good look, since the bazaar we were headed for was in the Cathedral's park.  At this particular bazaar, people sell old knick knacks and antiques.  19th Century Turkish daggers, nickel-plated Soviet liquor flasks, silver cigarette cases, old E. European currency, and for some reason, used cameras.  Our first two stops were uneventful, with either bad prices or faulty mechanisms.  The third time was the charm.  Two coffee-and-cream colored guys (were they Bulgarianized Turks?) stood behind a table full of Zenit and Kiev (both Russian brands) cameras.  Within 20 minutes, I had found 3 cameras in good working order, along with several extra lenses.  A SLR (single-lens-reflex) Zenit with a viewfinder light-meter and a good 58mm lens was going for $35.  Amazing, since it was basically a Russian copy of my Pentax K1000, which cost me $130 (slightly used, including a 50mm lens) in the states.  As we began to talk, we found that the boss, Krasamir, was from Blagoevgrad.  After telling him our situation, he made a spectacular offer:  He would round up as many basic, cheap Zenits and Kievs as he could lay his hands on, have his repair-man check them all over, and bring them to Blagoevgrad in 2 weeks.  The fact that we were prepared to spend at least $400 on 10+ cameras probably helped.<p> <I><center>To be continued in Volume 7, issue 1, GDT</I></center><br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
