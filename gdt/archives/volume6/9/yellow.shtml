You know, America can often become a very sane place to live in when compared to places like, say, Ecuador....<br>  <dd>   Abdala Bucaram, former mayor of the city of Guayaquil, was recently elected president of the Ecuador by popular vote, despite the fact that he had been in self-exile TWICE during his mayorship whilst evading fiscal mismanagement charges lodged against him. In fact, this man owns the proud moniker of "El Loco" -- "The Madman," given to him because of his irrational stunts and wilful disregard of the people's rights.<br>   <dd>   Hmm. His publicist during the election must've been Robert Shapiro. Either that or his opponent was Satan (not to be confused with C. Diablo).<br>  <dd>    Anyhoo, Crazy Man gets elected into office and immediately proceeds to barricade his presidential mansion with barbed wire and soldiers galore. Not a very heartwarming sight for ambassadors, I'm sure.<br>   <dd>   Believe it or not, things get nuttier from here.<br>   <dd>   Last week, the Ecuadorian government removed him from office on the grounds of "mental incapacity." Using that same logic, Clinton could easily be impeached for "Extramarital promiscuity."<br>    <dd>  After Bucaram's removal, the Congress was prepared to name Fabian Alarcon the new president of Ecuador when new VP Rosalia Arteaga stepped in, declaring that according to the constitution, she was the rightful prez of Ecuador.<br>   <dd>   So the Congress shrugged its shoulders, content to wait until her term was over...<br>   <dd>   ...when suddenly, five days later, she resigned.<br>    <dd>  So the Congress announced Alarcon president.<br>   <dd>   Then Arteaga stated that the Congress did not have the right to select presidents, and that another election would have to be held.<br>    <dd>  Just to illustrate how insane this whole process has been, let me quote the opening paragraph of the CNN article: "While Congress met Tuesday to name Fabian Alarcon president of Ecuador for the second time in five days, acting president Rosalia Arteaga submitted her resignation and last week's president, Abdala Bucaram, left the country."<br>    <dd>  Here's another interesting, very understated quote:<br>  <dd>    "...Ecuadorean politicians set about resolving a situation they fear is making a laughingstock of Latin America."<br>   <dd>   ...<br>  <dd>    ...<br>   <dd>   (snicker)<br>   <dd>   (giggle)<br>    <dd>  So, while chaos reigns supreme in the city of Quito, Bucaram is touring South America, trying to gain support for his return to power, which he says should occur in a about a week. According to Arteaga, no one can assume power until August 10, 1998, when the next election is scheduled to take place.<br>  <dd>    Well, the next time you complain about American politics being bogged down in bureaucracy, about it moving too slowly, just consider the alternative.<br>    <dd>  This is Vinny Bove, reporting to you not-so-live from Hoboken, New Jersey (in my heart, man! In my heart I'm there).<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume6/authors/vb.html">Vinny Bove</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
