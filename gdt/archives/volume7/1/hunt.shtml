Steve is now $75 dollars richer...which is a lot more than the rest of you. Steve correctly identified fifteen of the quotes for a total score of 21 points out of a possible 55. Coming up in second place, winning absolutely nothing, is Andrea Chrisman, one of the editors of the Iconoclast. Third place goes to Mark Cicero, co-editor of the Melancholy Predator (are you noticing a trend here?). Dragging up the rear was Troy Liston, writer for GDT.<br>     <dD> Of course, people could claim that the entire contest was a sham, but they'd be wrong. The only people not allowed to enter were the head editors of GDT (who, incidentally, were the only ones who worked on the contest and knew the answers). Besides, if you can find anyone else that entered the contest...they're a liar. In short, the publications of Hell's Kitchen apparently have a monopoly on the intelligentsia and creative spelling of RIT, the U of R, and Rutgers. Check to see if you would have done better and then kick yourself. You're out $75.<br></td></tr></table><br><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>1.
