Shortly after marrying his sixth and last wife, the delectable Green-Sleeves herself, he bullied a Parliament consisting entirely of Englishmen to proclaim him King of Ireland. With his convenient break with the papacy and creation of the Church of England, he was able to declare the Catholic (means "universal," don't-cha-cha-cha-know) religion null and void.<br>    <dd>  Unfortunately, Ireland was 99 and 44/100th Catholic. Already things were getting a bit tense.<br>    <dd>  For the English, Ireland was convenient for their latest program: world domination and an early alpha release of the white man's burden. The non-feudal Irish were seen as barbarians and it was the responsibility of the English to feudalize, Protestantize, and generally push aside. With super-duper secret orders, King Henry VIII I-am I-am demanded the capture of all trade and commerce in Ireland. In addition, he began a practice of having the sons of Irish nobles kidnapped and raised as good Englishmen (i.e., dead Englishmen. Oh, sorry. I guess that goes without saying doesn't it?). Once grown, these puppets to I-am I-am, secure in the superiority of their English upbringing, would return to Ireland and demand the right to replace their Irish birth-fathers as chief of a territory. More often than not, civil war would erupt in the particular region. The uppity English-raised rug rat would be supported by English troops and often won. Once in place, England would either no longer recognize their claim to power, or trump up some charge of treason. Either way, the result was the same: the lands controlled by the Chief were forfeited to the English crown.<br>   <dd>  In a classic example of differing world views, this seemingly straight forward approach of the English failed. The English were a feudal society in which the Lords owned the land; the Irish, however, never suffered feudalism. The land was not something that could be given or taken from the Chief. It belonged to the people. So after much political wrangling (Hyah! WWWWWCHTTTTTT!), Henry VIII I-am I-am was facing a bunch of very snippish Celts. In came the soldiers, killing the "rebels" and burning as many homes as possible.<br> <IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Anyone who has read Chapter 3 of <I>The Prince</I> by Machiavelli should recognize this particular tactic. After the land was cleared of the Irish,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a> good-old <I>loyal</I> English, Scots, and Welsh were brought in to resettle the land. From that time the practice of Plantation became a fixed policy to "exterminate and exile the country people of the Irishry," and to banish that fresh wholesome smell of the Irish spring with their smelly western European corpses. To forward this policy, historians and poets were systematically hunted and killed (often covering their remains with gravy and a side dish of peas), their genealogies destroyed, their beauticians terrorized, and Gaelic banned, all in attempts to end Irish culture and replace it with a more civilized English one.<br><dd>     As Queen Elizabeth took the throne and continued in Henry I-am I-am's policies, the Irish had finally had enough. Four rebellions took place under Elizabeth. The fourth was the single most important. Called The Flight of Earls, it saw the removal of several important Chiefs and the subsequent plantation of their lands.<br>  <dd>   Despite the serious shit going down in Irish Town, things remained remarkably calm until the 21st of October in 1641 when settlers and Irish both rose up against the English. In one night, all of Ulster was retaken. Leinster and Munster later joined and the English were all but driven from the island.<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   The English invented stories of slaughters of Protestants at the hands of the revolting Irish. In this climate, Charles I was executed, and Oliver Cromwell, Lord High Protector of England, entered the scene in a big way, and why not, for he was a big man.<br> <dd>    In 1649 Oliver Cromwell, Agent of God the Just, First Friend of the Irish, and his army arrived in Ireland like an avenging angel. Equipped with the newest in savage control (cannons), he rolled across Ireland like a bunch of hicks driving a monster truck. First stop in his Irish tour was Drogheda ("Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!") where he slaughtered 3000 men. He continued on to Wexford where he helped the crops by killing 2000 more men.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a> In less than a year, Ollie Cromwell and his Ironsides had re-captured Ireland, effectively crushing all armed resistance, and fixed the squeak in the seat-tilt control.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images1/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    Thanks to the First Friend of the Irish and those that followed him, Ireland was nearly empty by 1652. Close to 5/6 of the entire population of Ireland was killed, either through armed hostilities, famine, plague, or roving packs of wolves preying on the homeless and displaced natives robbed of their lands ("It's cold and there are wolves after me!").<br>    <dd>  What a guy. No wonder the Irish think he's so cool. Really. Go to any IRA meeting and let them know you think Oliver Cromwell really had his shit together. It's fun.<br>    <dd>  Quick to seize their opportunity, England began a massive program of transplantation. Parliament forced all Irish from East of the Shannon River, adding just a little extra misery to an already endangered people. For shits and giggles, they instituted the Penal Laws in 1653. Under them it was illegal for the Irish to do just about anything:<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images1/1.5.gif"><br><UL><LI>Exercise religion.<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#164;</A></a><LI>Receive education.<LI>     Enter a profession.<LI>     Hold public office.<LI>Engage in trade or commerce.<LI>Live in a corporate town or within five miles thereof.<LI>Own a horse of greater value than five pounds.<LI>  Hop on one foot and pat their head.<LI>   Purchase land.<LI>Lease land.<LI>   Vote.<LI>Hiccuping and farting at the same time.<LI>Keep any arms for their protection.<LI>  Hold a life annuity.<LI> Be guardian to a child.<LI>  Own any horse of lesser value than five pounds.<LI>  Attend catholic worship.<LI>  Educate their children.<li>    Own a Chiapet&#153;</UL><br><dd>    In short, the only legal option left the upstanding Irish citizenry was to eat shit and die. Dead ones were ok, but those living ones were just a pain. The Penal laws remained in effect in one form or another up until the Catholic Emancipation in 1829.<br>   <dd>  Cromwell go Bragh!<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Did you know that in the 1600s, when China had colonies in Eastern Africa and they discovered Giraffes, they had several brought back to the Emperor's court because the animal had the honor of looking exactly like their version of the Unicorn?
