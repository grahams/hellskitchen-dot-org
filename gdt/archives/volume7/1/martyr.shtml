Patrick wasn't Irish; he was Welsh-Italian. His real name wasn't Patrick, it was Succat. He wasn't the first Christian missionary to Ireland(that was St Palladius) and there were never any snakes in Ireland for him to drive out. He never intended to go to Ireland, he was kidnapped at the age of 16 and sold as a slave in the year 404. He escaped 6 years later and returned home to Wales but returned to Ireland as an adult to fulfill a destiny of evangalization foretold to him in a dream.  Along with being the Patron of Ireland he is also the Patron of Nigeria.<br>   <dD>  A popular pilgrimage site is the <B>Purgatory of St Patrick</B> located on an island of Lough Dergh in Ulster, Ireland. It is a large subterranean cave where our saint used to go to perform acts of penance and spend time alone in meditation and reflection. Some believe that if one spends a substantial amount of time in the cave one will be spared the sufferings of purgatory in the next life (or in the wait for the next life).<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
