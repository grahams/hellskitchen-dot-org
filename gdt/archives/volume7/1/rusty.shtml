He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

I hadn't had a hamburger for four months, and the possibility of eating anything that brought back heartland memories was titillating. Our foray had been an unexpected success, and we were in a mood to celebrate. Passing a string of flower stands, Tina and I started talking about how much we liked all sorts of flowers. I couldn't help stopping to buy her a bunch of pumpkin-orange daisies. I've never seen daisies this color, and their brightness certainly expressed our ebullient mood. She was charmed and delighted by the surprise.<br>    <dD>  The Sofia McDonald's was the perfect example of what McDonald's would like to be in the US. A mob of customers was frantically excited about getting some "real" American food. The employees were delighted with jobs that allowed them to dish out something that was so urgently desired, while their working conditions (which looked a bit cleaner than in the US) and clean, pressed uniforms illustrated their pride in joining the "McDonald's Team." Two floors of seating was something I'd never seen in the states, and the marble-top tables, hardwood wall sidings, well-placed lighting, and clean floors created a surprisingly enjoyable atmosphere. At the counter I ordered "Edno Big Mak, edno Shokolad Sheak, e Golyama Kartofki." The counter-boy broke into a huge smile and answered "Big Mac, Chocolate Shake, and large Fries!" He was very excited to practice his English, going so far as to count out my change.  As he handed me my order, I said, "Bwagodariya!". The reply, "You're welcome, have a nice day!". This was just weird. But the food was EXACTLY the same as a US McDonald's, and it was somehow great to eat something that I would never eat in the states and enjoy it so much more in Bulgaria. I can't remember the last time I was in a US McDonald's.<br>  <dD>    This was a striking example of how American economic culture had invaded and decimated Eastern European competition. What was so unique about it was how much of a cultural phenomenon it was. My meal cost me a little less than $3, which was cheaper than an American McDonald's, but as expensive as a dinner in a modest Bulgarian mehana (traditional restaurant). Yet, Bulgarians were flooding in the door to buy the American equivalent of a tasteless $20 lunch. I wondered how much different this was than Europeans selling glass beads to American Indians.  Has the human race changed so little in all this time?  The Bulgarians were happy to work in this job that Americans consider sinfully degrading. How much company propaganda were they being fed? In pure economical sense, it was a good improvement for the average working class Bulgarian: they worked hard, and were probably better respected, treated, and paid than they ever had been under the Communists. But is the future really a slick plastic highway fronting a global stretch of McDonald's, concrete apartment high-rises, and Tower Records shops? How putridly clean, and terrifyingly faceless this crushing American world-wide invasion has become. Bulgarians are happy to have McDonald's, because the Western Cultural Invasion is more gentle than previous invasions. Since the Middle Ages, other cultures have successively invaded and dominated Bulgaria.  McDonald's is only more pleasant than the Turks and Soviets were. Capitalism doesn't need to rape villages or create political police, because it can crush the spirit of those who oppose it through economic marginalization. One of these days I'll probably return to Bulgaria to find my well-loved all-night banitsa bakeries replaced by Dunkin' Donuts shops. How long before Bulgarian Gypsies and  Turks (easily equivalent to American Blacks and Hispanics in socio/economic status) are dying in crack houses and midnight gunbattles to control those crack houses?<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
