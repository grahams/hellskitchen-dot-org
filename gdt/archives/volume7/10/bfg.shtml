I still have a back-log of questions to answer, but have the whole summer off to rest my little grey cells. I'd like to assure all of those who sent me questions that I will eventually swing around to them, probably in the next volume. The questions I've got stashed away for the summer fall into one of three groups: fucking stupid, uninteresting, or excellent questions that are so good they've got me stumped for the present. I will eventually get to all of them in good time. I chose these last two questions, because one was just the kind of crap I hate getting, and the other was an interesting question that I probably didn't do justice to from some great people at the U of R. I wanted to fit that last one in to encourage such intelligent interaction with U of R students. To anyone else who wishes a question answered in not necessarily the correct manner, but at least an interesting one, then keep sending questions on to me. I enjoy it. It allows me to continue putting off those ones that I just don't feel like answering. Have a nice summer.<br></td></tr></table><table width = 500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>D<FONT SIZE =-1>EAR</font size> B<FONT SIZE =-1>ARE-FOOT</font size> G<FONT SIZE =-1>IRL</font size>,<BR><DD> S<FONT SIZE =-1>PEAKING OF FEET, WHICH WE WEREN'T BUT</font size>, I <FONT SIZE =-1>WAS WONDERING WHY DO MY FEET SMELL BAD</font size>?

Must be my favorite subject. Mustn't it?<br>   <dD>  If you were expecting a silly answer, I'm sorry, you pushed the wrong button. Prepare for the electric shock you fuck'n mooley. I'm afraid that idiotic questions about one's feet make me grumpy. So expect a little candor.<br> <dd>    Your feet smell bad because you wear shoes and socks a large proportion of the time. All through the day your feet radiate the greatest amount of heat from your body. Often this heat generates sweat, especially from your feet. So if you spend long periods of time moping around in socks and/or shoes, you create hot humid conditions within the closed conditions of your shoes. Your shoes become the perfect nesting/breeding ground for a variety of fun bacteria.<br>   <dd>   Now, I'm assuming that you don't thoroughly bathe your socks and especially shoes everyday with you when you get into that shower, so you are continually putting your semi-sanitary peds-that-xing into foul vesicles of microscopic miscreants every time you squeeze your little piggies into your favorite old pod-cozies.<br>    <dd>  In fact, the less you wear of shoes, the lower your chance of succumbing to such parasitic pals as Athlete's Foot. These jovial little buggers can't attach themselves readily, nor even attempt to cling, to someone whose feet remain dry. This is not to say that if you walk around barefoot your feet don't sweat as much, but they are not constrained within a closed system such as shoes, and thus air flow allow the feet to dry without all the unnecessary bacterial bystanders. In this instance, most of the smells wafting up from your nether regions will be more strongly determined by what you just stepped in and not the more common microbe of the month club.<br>   <dd>  Next time any of you has a question like that, just keep it to yourself. I don't know all this stuff because I walk around barefoot, I know it because I am a reasonably intelligent mammal, gifted apparently with the uncommon gift of common sense.<br>  <dd>   -the Bare-foot Girl<p></multicol></td></tr><tr><td valign = top width = 500><multicol cols=2 gutter=8>D<FONT SIZE =-1>EAR</font size> B<FONT SIZE =-1>ARE-FOOT</font size> G<FONT SIZE =-1>IRL</font size>-<BR><DD> W<FONT SIZE =-1>HAT KIND OF NEUROSIS IS IT WHEN YOU CONSTANTLY WANT THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE</font size>?

If you pick up your favorite copy of the Old Testament and briefly flip to that worn section near the ten commandments, you'll find it. It's called coveting, and boy does God get his proverbial panties in a bind when he catches the scent of that particular sin on his mortal coils. If the Soup-Nazi were Gabriel, he'd say "No savior for you!" You get the idea.<br>  <dd>   The best way to beat this mortal sin seems to be a little eccentric. You need to shave you head, speak with a particularly pompous brogue, and be sure to carry lots of little pictures of the Pope about your person to tear apart whenever the need arises. If that doesn't work, try a little garlic.<br> <dd>    -the Bare-foot Girl<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
