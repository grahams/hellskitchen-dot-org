In GDT's short life span, never have the editors been so burnt out.<br>   <dd>   Though we have recently received a great deal of support from readers in the city of Rochester, the U of R, MCC, and from the faculty at RIT (our homeland prior to the Scattering), we no longer receive mail from student readers at RIT. Articles that we cringe about publishing cause no phone calls or e-mails. Instead, a few "concerned individuals" often wander to our backside and ask people like Vice President Stan McKenzie to stop the madness.<br>   <dd>   GDT started (among other reasons) as an alternate method for students and faculty to express themselves. Faculty, instead of producing prosaic pieces condemning us for our intolerance, or even contributing pieces to help keep their buried yet still breathing muses fed, simply sit back, pat us on the head, and sometimes contribute to our wellness fund (these donations are always appreciated), and politely don't get involved.<br>  <dd>    "It's a student publication. Why should I get involved?"<br>   <dd>  And most students seem to think that GDT is an elite little club. Well...it is. We seem to be the few students and alumni willing to stick our necks out and try something subversive. We (Hell's Kitchen collectively)produce a   weekly publication that now links four geographically separated campuses and two different cities. I don't know of anything else that is as regular or is attempting the same feat.<br>  <dd>   These are not new complaints, however. Long ago we steeled ourselves against the immense inertial apathy inherent in established structures. We were not entirely successful, however, and have found ourselves down to the bare wire as far as all of the intensive bureaucratic bullshit we had to tolerate to get the job done.<br>   <dd>   In July, the Hell's Kitchen Federation of publications began. Three meager publications in two cities, but with hopes of attracting new members. To that end, we drafted a constitution that would facilitate relations between the groups.<br>    <dD>  We meant well. We really did. But instead of reducing our workload, we increased it, driving the Founders mad with paperwork and subconscious self-loathing.<br>   <dd>   On top of that, we learned the hard way that a creative/satirical publications are not considered marketable advertising space. To easy to collect bruised egos there. Yes, we managed to get some ads this year, but it was like pulling fingernails. We'd need a full-time staff just to keep advertisers interested, and we don't have the time or manpower.<br>  <dd>   In our favor, we did start offering subscriptions, gained a wonderful new writer, ended our two year feud with the Reporter, opened relations with the Norm (UorR's men's group- I mean humor magazine), met people interested in having their publications co-operate/join Hell's Kitchen, and expanded onto MCC. All in all this is a good list, but we're still tired.<br>   <dd>   We encourage everyone seriously interested in helping to do so. Many people have said they were interested, but they never showed. We're sick of GDT being the "Sean and Kelly Show" and are more than willing to let people come in and start taking over our current positions. You don't have to go to RIT or even be a student. All that's required is that you are dedicated enough to do the job to the best of your ability.<br>  <dd>    When we started writing two years ago, we had three people on the staff; two writers and an illustrator. We produced one full page of material a week until we realized the page had another side. Paid for from our own pockets, we printed up sixty copies a week. It seemed at that point as if we could continue churning out such material forever. But now we spend so much time each week trying to get first page articles done, writing and correlating six pages worth of material, and trying desperately to get illustrations from anywhere that we have little time to relax, unwind, and prepare ourselves for the upcoming issue. Even though the head editor's of GDT have become tired and worn out, we still expectantly look towards next spring when our one hundredth issue should be printed.<br>   <dd>   Realistically, however, we are uncertain whether or not we will be able to maintain our current workload for that long. We would love to find people to pass this garland onto, people to take over the reigns to find out where they may take this publication next, but there is absolutely no one vying for that role. There are a few members of the staff, but none wish to take our places. This makes us afraid that this publication that we founded, raised, and spent so much of our collegic career working on may have only a very short future to look forward to. We can not continue working at this level for much longer. This is neither a threat nor a warning, merely a matter of time at this point.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
