Touted as the diary of Angelica Cottington, the book is a clever combination of a narrative similar in style to Flowers for Algernon and wonderful illustrations that are meant to be the psychic impressions left after squashing several dozen faeries in a notebook.<br><dd>   As is the case in good satire (or least when the general reader isn't on their toes), it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction. Unbeknownst to most people who enjoyed the Pressed Fairy Book, there is a seed of truth behind the fiction. The book begins with a sort of introduction:<br><table><tr><td valign = top width = 5></td><td valign = top width = 245><I>Of course everyone is familiar with the famous photograph of the small girl surrounded by fairies, which caused such a sensation when it was first published in The Regular Magazine in 1907. It inspired many imitations and was hailed in many quarters as the final, irrefutable proof of the existence of faeries. No less an authority on the subject than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was fully persuaded of its authenticity, and spoke to packed audiences of its significance, particularly in the Manchester area. J.M. Barrie himself was convinced that he recognized at least one of the fairies in the photograph, and the Rev. Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) appeared from beyond the grave to clairvoyants up and down the country to vouch for the veracity of the photograph.</I><br></td></tr></table><dd>  In point of fact, there is actually a great deal of truth in that opening statement. Beyond that point, however, the author is having a great deal of fun with his readers.<br> <dD>    The "famous photograph" mentioned has been reproduced thousands of times around the world. Taken in July 1917 by 16 year old Elsie Wright of Cottington, England, it showed her 10 year old cousin Frances Griffith with a number of fairies dancing in front of her. A second less known photo shows Elsie with a gnome.<br>  <dd>   Elsie's parents both suspected trickery and searched the girl's room looking for paper cut-outs, and even searched the beck where the girls claimed that they frequently saw fairies. They found no evidence. The pictures were shown to family and friends, but interest in them quickly died out.<br>   <dd>  And the whole incident would have been forgotten if Elsie's mother hadn't attended a 1919 meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. It being the late teens/early 1920's everyone who was anyone was interested in Spiritualism. If you hadn't seen a ghost or gone to a s&eacute;ance, you were a social pariah. The particular lecture Polly Wright attended was on "fairy life," and she mentioned that her daughter had taken photographs of fairies. Well, a statement like that was akin to saying, "Oh, did I mention I'm Adolf Hitler?" at a Friends for Fascism rally. Word of the photographs spread to a leading theosophist named Edward Gardner, who then passed prints of them on to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br>   <dd>   Doyle, of "Sherlock Holmes" fame, happened to be a fanatical Spiritualist. At the time he received the photographs, he was working on an article on fairies for a Christmas edition of <I>Strand Magazine</I>. As he prepared the article, he dispatched Gardner to interview the Wright family. Upon returning, Gardner reported that the family seemed honest and totally respectable. Both Doyle and Gardner felt that if more photographs were obtained, it would put the matter beyond question. Gardner again journeyed to Cottington with cameras and 20 photographic plates which he left with Elsie and Frances hoping they would take more photographs. <br>  <dd>  Doyle's article was printed at the end of November 1920, and sold out within days. The subject of much ridicule, Elsie and Frances were interviewed by several reporters. Each was forced to return with little new evidence, no sign of trickery, and the feeling that the family was not hiding anything.<br>   <dd>   Things died down, but then erupted again when Elsie and Frances claimed to photograph three more faeries in 1920. Again, controversy surrounded the two girls, and reporters swarmed over the area, searching for trickery. None could be found. Geoffrey Hodson, a clairvoyant, came in and claimed to see faeries. Elsie agreed, though she later admitted she humored Hodson to the point of leading him along.<br> <dd>    In 1971 the BBC's Nationwide programme interviewed Elsie back in Cottington. Though she continued to strongly deny that her father had  any hand in the photographs, she refused to swear whether the photographs were faked.<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images10/fey.gif"><br><font size = +1><B><center>Elsie Wright and a gnome.

It wasn't until the mid 1980's that one of the two women came forward and confided that the faeries were nothing but paper cut-outs mounted of wire frames.<br>   <dd>  So much for faeries.<br><br></multicol></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
