We're not     stupid: we're ignorant. There's a difference. You see, Grasshopper, ignorance is when one is blissfully unaware of facts, such as how to spell and use correct grammar. Now, someone is stupid when they know something, but don't pay it no nevermind. It's kind of like, "I know in my heart that you love me, but I don't know it in my head." Stupid.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images10/1.1.gif"><br>   <dd>  Case in point: the apartment I'm living in right now has crap-assed wiring. For a while it was impossible to have a light on, the TV running, and use the microwave for longer than 43 seconds before blowing a fuse. The fun part was that every god-damned light leading down to the cellar was on the same circuit. When you blew a fuse you were in the dark the whole way. I knew that. I mean, after the first time the fuse blew I discovered just how much the lights in the cellar didn't work. So I learned to get my flashlight before trekking into the dark. One time the flashlight was in a room with a bunch of clutter. I entered the room and flipped the light switch on. To turn on the light. So I could find the flashlight. So I could fix the light. I was acting out of habit instead of thinking.<br>  <dd>   Stupid.<br><dd>   Thoreau called non-stupidness "living deliberately."  At one point he mumbled, "I went into the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." In a early draft found earlier this year, he put it this way: "I ran away from home because I was sick of acting stupid in front of mother." It wasn't until he saw he had beaten a path from the door of his cabin to the pond that he realized he had replaced one life of non-deliberateness (stupidness) with another; it was why he finally left his little club house at Walden.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a><br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images10/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Everyone is stupid at one point or another: Hitler's decision to invade Russia (...never wage a land war in Asia!), the Austrians trying to stop tanks with horses and pikes, ("Otto...was gibt mit deinen Panser?"), the Republicans raising such a big stink about the Democrats taking money from foreigners when they still had their hands in the same   cookie jar. Stupid, stupid, stupid.<br>  <dd>   So in all fairness, such wonderful statements like the one carved into the wood surface of my old high school lab bench stating in simple, almost runic lettering, "Stupid People Should Not Breed," (No, I didn't put it there. I sometimes I think my Biology instructor did. He was way too pleased with it.) should not necessarily be made into an edict from the Pope. If it were there would be no one left to be stupid. We'd all be dead.<br><dd>   It's a good premise from a eugenic<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> point of view (I don't swim in your toilet, don't pee in my pool), however. Thin the ranks out a bit. Stronger stock.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> Trim the fat, so to speak.<br><dd>   Unfortunately, there's the messy business of enforcing that particular decree and making sure there are no repeat offenders with the help of some rubber bands, scissors, and high beta-particle emitting 35S laced undergarments covered with a lead-leaf for the little ladies. You could conceivably avert the whole messy business of sterilization and having to spend billions of dollars stopping the illegal flow of dumb blonds from Scandinavia (which seem to be flooding our own American dumb blond  market) by looking to nature for an example. When an animal screws up in the wild, the biggest,  clearest, most unmistakable sign that they did something very, very stupid is that they are dead. One minute you're a squirrel trying to get a Snickers bar from a guy with a huge grin on his face, and the next minute, Q-FUCKING BOOM!<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images10/1.3.gif"><br><dd>   Why not just say that stupid people shouldn't live? Oh, but we couldn't possibly pass a law like that. It's wrong. It's immoral. Besides, if we did that we'd never have the pleasure of watching those damn dullards kill themselves in inventive and mind-boggling moronic new ways. Some call it "Evolution in Action" whereas I would prefer to call it good-old-fashioned fun.<br>  <dd>    Justify yourself do you ask? No, I don't have to justify the deaths of imbeciles. They should have to justify their existence.<br> <dd>    The problem is that the morons aren't dying off. In fact, our entire society is geared to pampering to these dullards. Ever since childhood, with grade curves and special-ed programs for the nitwit class, the system has compensated for these ultimately challenged individuals. Many of our modern laws are geared towards keeping these unnecessary simpletons, not only on God's green earth, but allowing them to continue swapping spit, genetic lineage, and occasionally parent the odd diploid or twelve (more welfare that way).<br>    <dd>  A woman spills hot coffee on herself and it's not her fault. It should have had a warning on it, of course. The same goes for the guy who picked his child up into a spinning ceiling fan. Not his fault. There wasn't a warning label on the fan saying, "Do not shove children in whirling blades of fan while running."<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images10/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    Our age is not one of space, information, or grace; we live in the age of Aquarius...oh no, warning labels (sorry about that). Everything from sun screens on cars that read "Remove before driving," to five gallon buckets that warn "Do not leave child unattended near bucket," and kazoos that say things like "Use other end."<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> For Christ's sake, Pez dispensers have diagrams and instructions on how to load the Pez...or Prosaic if you prefer. These things seem even stranger when in comparison with things that actually need warning labels...like guns. Guns should have little notices near the end of the barrel saying, "Point away from face" or, "Do not put in mouth."<br><dd>    Thanks to well meaning people (or maybe they're just bitter bastards that stepped on a rake and got clobbered like in the cartoons. Don't laugh. I've done it), like MENSA (Mental Entropy's Not So Astricting), the lobbyist group for all the stupid people, all the little threats are being systematically being cauterized from our lives. The next item you see a warning label on is going to be a pencil. A stencil on the outside will warn "Not for use on genitals" or "Only for use on genitals with adult supervision."<br>  <dD>   Thankfully, there are those dedicated few who, thanks to apathy, continue to put out faulty products. Here's to the men who designed the Ford Pinto (BOOM!), the old Boba Fett action figures that shot rockets down the throats of unsuspecting babes, lawn darts filling the air with their barrage of fun, and, of course, motorized Cabbage Patch Kids that eat the hair of children.
