This is his last entry from Byzantium's last shore. Soon, he will be returning to the United States. I just wanted to take this opportunity to publically thank Chris for doing such a great job this past year. Though thousands of miles away, he was one of our most reliable writers and supporters. Be safe in your travels, Chris.<br>								<dd>		-Sean Hammond, co-editor, GDT<br></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8> May 1st, 1997 -<br>  <dd>   We're sitting at the big plastic tables of Gorna Djumaya restaurant, looking over the church and the edges of Varosha (old town). With much laughter and glass clicking (it's great fun to be able to say "Cheers" in 6 languages) Vladamir and I are introducing Jen, his American girl, to Rakia. Dave is quiet and day dreamy beside Vlad, and Maggi is giving us her slow stare through my heavy black sunglasses. In the courtyard of the church below, people are milling around on sun drenched stones. It's tee-shirt weather after the long doldrums of cold grey rain, and I'm lazy, happy in the cool Spring sun. The Rakia is a cool flavor in my mouth and my neck is warm without sweat.<br>  <dd>   Maggi smiles her pouty smile. "Hey Chris, how are you?"<br>   <dd>  I look out into the sky for a long time, across the foothills of the Pirin, over the Struma river valley, and into the mountains of Macedonia. All the mad adventures and, crisp sights, nights of lovemaking, and moments of wretched failure string through my mind in a rapid flash of memories and scents. There's Krista and Kara, playing on Sozopol beaches; Silvia crying in my arms as she tells me it's over; Thorne and Kael haggard in a Belgrade cafe as we wipe the stench of tear gas out of our clothes; Joshua spouting his madman prose while we wander the tangled little streets of Matera; Gueri shaking out her wild long locks while dancing to Pearl Jam in her little Sofia apartment; Vladamir starring his toothy grin at me over big glasses of gin in Bar Milena; Maggi giving me her long sad look after we decide it's best not to be married, then taking me home to make love. The view from the old Citadella over Budapest at night; the wild eyed fear of watching Milosevic's "Special Forces" spill across Belgrade in their tall blue and grey uniforms; the beat frustration of walking through Thessaloniki in the winter rains, broke and hungry enough to steal from a fruit cart; the shock and fear of Bulgaria's crisis, bread lines and fuel shortages; the cold beauty of Sveta Petka and the incredible kindness of the Pomatsi; the throaty laughter of Maggi's father, and the softness of her lips.<br>  <dd>   It's coming to a close now. In a few weeks I'll be long gone from Bulgaria, to return to the sweat and gasoline stink of Texas summer. All these people and places, they'll all be fragments of my memory, the sound of laughter that will echo in my mind some night in the midst of an Austin slacker crowd. Maybe the tramp of soldier's feet will bring back the fear and adrenaline of Belgrade and send me under a chair in hiding. There's only a few more days to feel Bulgaria's rough caress. Only a little while before I return to the plastic world of computers and business ties.<br>   <dd>  I take a slow sip of the strong grape liquor and let its sweet flavor hang on my palate for a long time. For a moment it feels like I've been leaving places all my life.<br>  <dd>   "I'm fine baby, I'm fine."<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
