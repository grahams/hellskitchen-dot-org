Unlike some people on the staff ("Sean, you get back in that corner! You still need a time out."), I have felt this from the very start. The problem is that when I started this whole thing with my co-head, I neglected to even think of putting a choke collar on some of his actions. As of now...<br> <dd>  <B> This war is over!</B><br>    <dd>  The only casualties added up to a few bent egos, several frazzled nerves, the destruction of a GDT spinoff specifically made for the <I>Reporter</I>, <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>, killed at the hands of that fiend Jas("Hey! Who let him get near the keyboard?! Get him quick!")lsdk sadfa hnmn goitstuo and maybe a hurt feeling here or there. Mr. Hammond is now nursing his wounds quietly in the corner ("Hold him tight. I think he suspected we were going to do this and lubed himself up with butter. He's slicker than banana slugs."). He will live to bare another cross and fight another war, but not this one. No more will GDT's gauntlet be raised against the <I>Reporter</I>, in this uninteresting, no-win situation.<br>   <dd>   In the end it comes down to two things: we each have what the other wants in some small degree. The <I>Reporter </I> needs dedicated, decent writers...which we have in surplus. We, on the other hand, lack capital. Each week we produce more material than we can feasibly print, because we lack enough money to cover the extra cost.<br> <dd>    However, my esteemed colleague is correct in the assumption that often people require a nemesis to help drive themselves to greater heights. His choice of the <I>Reporter</I>  was poor, and he concedes this point ("Uncle! Uncle! Quit hitting me!"). The <I>Reporter</I>  is not to be considered a worthy advasary. As in pagan-Roman times, if the opponent is larger and more powerful than yourself, the vigilance necessary to keep up the struggle is many times more compelling. New nemesises have been chosen; whenever something needs to be done right, you need to do it yourself....<br>    <dd> Talk about biting the hand that feeds you...our minor foe is to be the beurocratic deficiencies of RIT, a field some of us know quite intimately. We also hope that some of our readers can help further our efforts in this area whenever they see the chance. We would appreciate any assistance.<br>   <dd>   Our prime enemy, or perhaps prime mover, is the deficiencies of our modern governmental system. Because this country no longer seems to be a government for the people, by the people, we will be taking our own stab at revolutionizing our era. No, we are not hippies or communists. We're Humorists. I think we need to decide if we can fix what we've got, and if it is not feasible, think of starting from scratch. I am not a political activist, nor am I a leader, but I'm tired of sitting around watching as lobby groups and big business take control of a decisive corner of our governmental policy. I don't want to live in a country where I will be required to pay the clean-up costs for whatever poisons and toxins any major industry should choose to spread around my home. I don't want to pay thousands of dollars my entire life to find out one day that my grandparents have eaten up my social security benefits. And I don't want to be any part of a country where it eventually becomes legal policy in a mid-western state to make all homosexuals register as such, or where it is illegal to fall asleep in a bath tub.<br>   <dd>  Where will the madness end?!<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
