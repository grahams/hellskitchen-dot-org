It's all over the news like necrotizing fasciitis...which is also all over the news. After slightly under a kajillion<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> unsuccessful attempts,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> Dr. Ian Wilmut of Scotland has recently cloned a sheep named Dolly.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> This has led to some obvious postemptive reactions in this country: every student who has ever asked if a differentiated cell could be made to be totiopotent by implanting its nucleus into an unfertilized egg has been vindicated, and a new senate subcommittee<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a> has sprung up <I>de novo</I>, dedicated to debating the ethics of the issue.<br><dd>  Cloning may be new and interesting, but the Senate debate itself is as foolish as ever. While they're hemming and hawing about the ethics of the technology, nobody has even mentioned the economic feasibility of the issue. Sheep are a precious commodity in some parts of the hills,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#5">&#131;</A></a> but if you can clone wool and lambchops then Dolly just becomes a freakshow type of novelty (Baaahh<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#6">&#131;</A></a>).  Sure, there will be a global audience wanting to see this touring sheep, but there's no chance of repeat customers: if you've seen one clone, you've seen them all.  Besides, can it really be cheaper to clone a sheep than to just wait for the damn things to go into heat and let nature run its wiggly, wily course?<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#7">&#131;</A></a> Why force the poor Scots into shame<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#8">&#131;</A></a> for creating this technology unless we're sure it isn't going to make us any money?<br><dd>   When the question of cash is on the table, why shiver at the mention of Brave New World and 1984? Turn those frowns upside down! It's time to stop reading those prophetic books as a warning and see them as a promise of a better tomorrow. Big Brother is already here...has been for quite some time. Spy satellites that can read the box of cigarettes your holding post images to the internet and with only a little electronic background, nearly anyone can go to Radio Shack and build sophisticated hacking and phreaking equipment. Modifications to oscilloscope and cellular phones allow people sitting in parking lots to learn PIN numbers from people using ATM cards.<br>   <dd>   We have all become Big Brother. There is no question of who watches the watchmen; we all watch one another. Misdirected voyeurism in the post-industrial world.<br>   <dd>   Where technological invasion into all of our lives has been accepted as a necessity of living in a dangerous world (a world where the dangers come from those who use the latest tools against us. Ouroboros anyone?), reproductive changes will be driven strictly by economics. Face it: sex sell. Prostitution is not only legal in many parts of the world, it is a thriving business with owners of some of the larger cathouses considering selling stock, and the only businesses able to succeed on the internet thus far have been dedicated to pornography. With women constantly applying to be artificial inseminated with the sperm of Nobel laureates and Forbes 500 groupies, there is a definite market. Cloning is just the next logical step.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    To paraphrase Harlan Ellison, what's the use of having money if you can't use it? There's a market for nearly everything: fake dog poop, white slavery, sleeping gimps, child porn, and most of it is done willingly. No one is being coerced into buying fake dog-poop. The best way for the government to control cloning would be economically. If they were really smart, they would change birth certificates so they could double as official copyright notices. Any human clones then become copyright infringements. Then they'd have to worry about China cutting black-market clones ("Hey buddy, want a spare?").<br>  <dd>   Besides, Hollywood (if she could) has made cloning out to be the coolest thing since the Spruce Goose and it's difficult to feel apprehensive. Movie after movie has shown the power of cloning. Jurassic Park: cloned dinosaurs running amuck killing people? Coooool. Multiplicity: a woman getting screwed by three genetically identical men? Again, cooooool. Clones of Adolph Hitler running around in Argentina? Well, not so cool...but funny.<br><dd>     Don't get me wrong, I understand the biological implications of cloning perfectly. I just don't care. A shrinking pool of genetic variation is a serious problem, biologically speaking, but if some stupid git thinks they are the apex of evolution and that it just doesn't get any better than this, so be it.  Even if an ego-maniac like George Foreman wants to make his offspring even more like himself (Hi, I'm George, this is my brother George, this is my other brother George,  and our newest edition... George), that's his business.  The desire for more sameness and continuity is in each of us to a greater or lesser degree. If it weren't, then most of the staff of GDT wouldn't have been so traumatized by all the kids in junior high trying to be just like each other...and trying to screw each others' siblings. Then again, frats and bitch-houses are along the same lines. For that matter, so is any social organization.<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images2/1.3.gif"><br>  <dd>   All biological concerns aside, I don't really see what the problem is. What's that, Senator Christopher "Git" Bond, a Missourian Republican? "Humans are not God and therefore should not play God"? Well, don't we do that already? You know, with the exception of a few individual parakeets and all cats, I've never run into a more self-important group with no particularly good reason for it than humans. Looking at things in perspective, you have to admit that mankind seems to think it can should play God just because we have opposable thumbs.<br>  <dd>   Don't believe me? OK. You're right, Fat Man and Little Boy could never be considered playing God.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#9">&#165;</A></a>  Then again, if we are made in God's image, maybe everything we do is driven by our desire to be God. After centuries of mystics searching for God, NASA's activities (the National Aeronautics and Space Association, as opposed to the National Association for Sword Advancement)  are only a more advanced version of the Tower of Babel. Besides, Yhwh told his cute little bipeds to be fruitful (i.e. not taste good with cheese) and multiply. Up until this moment we've only been able to add to our numbers. Thanks to Henry Ford and Dr. Ian Wilmut, humanity is on the verge of complying with Yhwh's commandment. We really could multiply.<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images2/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    Personally, I prefer to go about things in a more natural manner, but if some socially overzealous parents want to give birth to the most beautiful child in the world, who are we to forbid it? It's about time we killed our last sacred cow. Just as the sun does not revolve around the Earth, the Earth should no longer revolve around mankind.     At least Senator Tom Harkin, a Democratic Illianawan, agrees. That man has seen the future and is willing to replicate himself in it:      "To attempt to limit human knowledge is demeaning to human nature. What utter, utter nonsense to think we can hold up a hand and say stop it." He went on to say, "Human cloning will take place in my lifetime, and I don't fear it. I welcome it. I think it has untold benefits for humankind."     Right on, Tom! Now there's a man with vision! ("There's a man with vision. There's another man with vision. And there...oh...no, he's not a man with vision. My friend, you are blind. You are not a visionary.")<Table><tr><td valign = top align = center><center><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images2/1.5.gif"><br><B>Senator Tom Harkin looking quite pleased with himself.</B> <br></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"><A NAME="8"><A NAME="9"></A></A></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> How much is a kajillion, you ask?
