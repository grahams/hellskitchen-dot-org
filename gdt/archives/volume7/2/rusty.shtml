He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

Tina babbled about how much nicer the Bucharest McDonald's was. I wondered if she realized or would understand any of what I saw McDonald's as symbolizing. After poking through a huge book/magazine/newspaper bazaar, Tina and I decided to return to the cathedral before returning to Blagoevgrad. Architecturally, it was impressive for its massive and slightly bulbous appearance. While Catholic cathedrals have great stretching straight lines, Orthodox cathedrals seem to be designed with circles playing a greater importance than rectangles. The cathedral had the characteristically Orthodox rounded domes, three of copper-turned-bright-green and one of brilliant gold plating. Inside, the paintings and frescoes were disappointingly monumental. Although they were of the same style as the ones I'd seen at the Rila monastery, their hugeness somehow twisted the folksy charm of the style and turned it into some grandiose monument. However, the darkness of the interior turned their colors into somber and delicate tonal shifts (as opposed to the screaming brightness of the colors of Rila's paintings) which injected a sense of calm into the mood of the interior.<br>    <dd>  The bus back to Blagoevgrad was packed (no exhaust fumes this time), and I got the last seat, which proved to be the best: a jump-seat that folded out to put me shotgun with the driver, getting the whole view of the huge windshield. I promptly fell asleep after we pulled out of Sofia. Waking somewhere close to Dupnitsa (where Krista, Kara, and I had been almost stranded in the rain returning from Sozopol), I found that we were cresting a hill that afforded a monumental view: the huge Rila Mountains, sliding into the blue of dusk, with only their snow-topped crests lit with the burning red-gold of sunset. I cursed the fact that I was riding on a bus, and unable to get a nice color photo. But it's still bright and vivid in my mind, which seems in some ways superior. Something I might have to try to make this Focus group understand after they get their Russian cameras. <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
