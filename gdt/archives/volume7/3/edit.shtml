Rumors are always flying around about people who are hired right after graduation to join the elite intelligence agency. Hell, GDT has someone who is aspiring to those lofty heights.<br>    <dd>  With so many faculty on the pull for the CIA, I'm confident that if I wanted something to reach the correct people, it would. With that in mind, I present my open letter to the CIA...<p>Dear Mr. CIA Man,<br>  <dd>   First, I'd like to say that you have my utmost respect. For decades you have helped prop up puppet dictators and assassinate unfriendly heads of state with ease and finesse. I found your work in Jonestown particularly effective. Bravo.<br> <dd>    In keeping with your past successes, I'm asking that you please kill Netanyahu. I understand that Israel is a necessary ally to have in the oil rich middle east, but I think his actions have proven that he is an ASSHOLE!<br>   <dd>  Since stepping into office over (previous prime minister's name here)'s drying pool of blood, he has systematically alienated and provoked the Palestinians and Arabs in general.<br>  <dd>   Secretly opening the archeological tunnel under the mosque, refusing to keep to the agreed-to timetable for troop withdrawal, and forging ahead with the building of a Jewish settlement in the predominantly Arab community of Hebron are proof that the man's aim is the escalation of conflicts. As more and more terrorists strike, it will provide him with the justification he needs to retake the areas previously granted semi-autonomous Palestinian control.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images3/edit2.gif"><br><dd>    I would volunteer my services, but I am sure you have better trained and better equipped operatives to do the job. Instead, I will remain in the cushy United States and find some movie starlet to stalk.<br>  <dd>   Having written this, I will completely understand when I am visited by various law enforcement officials. If you call ahead, I will make sure I have enough tea for everyone.<p>Sincerely,<br><dd>Sean Hammond </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
