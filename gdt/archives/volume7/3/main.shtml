Starting on Palm Sunday and ending on Easter, GDT put out an issue a day, each dedicated to Religion in some form or another.<br>  <dd>   We had hoped to repeat this Herculean task this year, but budget constraints would not allow for it. What we did manage to do, however, was bring back a game that served as a way of sharpening the tongues of GDT's founders before we began printing. The game is simple: Using the alphabet, one person begins a childish rhyme such as "A is for apple," and then provides a description of some sort. The second person must then provide a B word and a description that would rhyme with the one given for A. For example:<br>	<table><tr><td valign = top width = 15></td><td valign = top><I>A is for apple, all shiny and round...<br>	B is for boy, smushed into the ground.</I><p></td></tr></table>  <dd>   You get the idea.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images3/1.1.gif"><br>  <dd>    Depending how good one is, a whole series of versions can be played. The hardest is where a person provides the ending description of one letter, and the word for the next letter. Tacticians such as my counter-part Kelly would inevitably stick me with trying to rhyme orange. Then again, she always had a hard time because she could never remember the accepted order of the letters in the alphabet.<br>  <dd>   Have fun with our latest creations. And remember, GDT can be just as artsy-fartsy as the <I>Melancholy Predator</I>.<p>	<table><tr><td valign = top width = 20></td><td valign = top><IMG  align = right
