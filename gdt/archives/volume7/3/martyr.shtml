This week we look at <B>St.John the Baptist </B>(<B>Feast Days: June 24 and August 29</B>)...</I><br>  <dd>   This "voice crying in the wilderness" was the precursor to the coming of the Messiah, and it was only with John's naming of the Nazarene as such that Jesus gained the credence among disbelieves that paved his way to Calvary. John was an ascetic and loner at times, and many saints throughout the ages have patterned their hermetic ways after him. John sank into obscurity after baptizing Jesus and spent the last years of his life as Herod's captive in the prison of Machaerus. John was decapitated, his head presented to the King's favorite stripper, Salome, on a silver platter.<br><dD>     Due to the close nature of our saint to the son of god (Luke claims that they were cousins), his relics are highly sought after and widely claimed. He has two feast days, one to celebrate his birth (<B>June 24</B>) and one to celebrate his martyrdom (<B>Aug 29</B>). If you ever wanted to visit all of our saint's repositories you would have to make a rather circuitous journey through Europe. The church of St. Sylvester in Rome claims to have the "best" part of the head (through my research this seems to include the brain); The Cathedral of Amiens prides itself in having a substantial section of John's face, consisting of the upper lip, nose, eyes and forehead; part of the skull is at Ville du Pay, France; The scalp is in Ste. Chapelle in Paris; the Abbey in Tyron, France claims to have the nape of the neck and John's brains (now housed in a skull brought to the Abbey by angels); Some of our saints ashes are venerated in Genoa, Italy; Part of the jaw (lower lip to the chin) is housed in the chapel of the chateau de St. Chaumont in Lyonnais, France; St. John's finger (the one with which he pointed out the lord saying "This is the lamb of God") is in Malta. Not to miss out on the party other churches in Turin, Aosta, Venice, Lyons, Nemours, Nola and Bresse all also claim to miraculously have parts of the head.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
