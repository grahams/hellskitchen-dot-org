Many a time going home from class I had stared in wonder at that beat-up old hunk of junk, with its packing-tape white-trash sunbathers enjoying the frigid Rochester weather (actually, I imagine if they had any motor control whatsoever, they'd get their adhesive butts indoors, and quick!). Once I found out it was actually an ART gallery, I knew I had to see it for myself.<br>   <dd>  So, after a few minutes of perusal, and having talked to the art student who was working there, I had to say I was thoroughly impressed. The gallery itself may not be beautiful or high-class, but the whole concept of the trailer is brilliant. It is an ANYTHING gallery (be it fine art, graphic art, literature, your biology homework, or a square of toilet paper with a particularly nice quilted pattern); if there's something you want to hang up, simply bring some pushpins and boom, suddenly your soul is on display for the whole campus to examine.<br> <dd>    The trailer is open at rather limited and odd times, but that can't be helped...it was built and is manned by a small group of art students who I'm sure have as little time on their hands as the art student writing this article does. But if you have a chance to go inside, please do. It's a great change of pace from the corporate coldness of our lovely campus, and a refreshing look at what a little bit of ambition and a whole lot of insanity can produce.    <br>               </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/vb.html">Vinny Bove</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
