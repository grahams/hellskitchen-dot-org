He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

I'm trying to finally knock out the rest of the Italian journal, and squeezing the last bit of it out begins to feel like squeezing blood from a finger that's been pricked.  The computer becomes the squeezing machine. So come midnight, when the labs close, I slide down to the Drum.<br>  <dd>   Under Volga dormitory there's a Macedonian restaurant (Volga used to be a hotel) that plays great Macedonian folk-rock music until midnight or so. I really liked their music the first night I stayed in Volga. After that, I realized that they only had one tape of the music and played it every night. At this point I don't even hear the music anymore. Beside the entrance to the Macedonian joint is a stairwell that leads to a basement. The walls of the stair-well are painted with all kinds of neon green and orange art-graffiti. At the bottom of the stairs are a pair of stinky bathrooms and an entrance to Club Drum. Inside it looks almost like a seedy American youth-bar. A huge picture of Jimmy Morrison stares off of one of the walls, there's black light here and there, and low yellow tungsten lights set at the top of the bar throw warm columns of luminance down on the bar. From somewhere in a dark corner, a photo of Ray Charles tosses his funky blind smile aimlessly into the room. The stereo is booming all kinds of Western pop, a lot of U2, Pulp Fiction, and Doors. This  is where the cool people go. On most nights of the week, Drum is crowded with girls and boys playing the Big Game. There's no dance floor, but they dance anyway. On a Friday night you might have to slither past couples grinding to Gypsy Kings to get to the bar. Unlike an American bar of this sort, most of the people aren't putting up the tough-boy front or the gone-girl cool. In Drum, Bulgarian bohemes try to imitate a Western scene, but they still bring their rude honesties.<br>   <dd>   At the bar, lipsticked counter girls with tired eyes serve two brands of Bulgarian beer (Pleven and Zagorka, both named after Bulgarian towns) and cheap Bulgarian liquors. Somewhere in the background is Kostadin, or Kosta, the big smiling man whose English has a beautifully fat accent. He's the owner and something of a local celebrity. In Blagoevgrad, everyone knows Kosta, and Kosta knows just about everybody. But even if you're a good friend of Kosta, at the bar you can't get a screwdriver or salty dog. If you ask for a gin and tonic in Bulgaria, they'll look at you strangely and give you a glass of gin and bottle of tonic. No one mixes their alcohols, they just knock them down straight. On a packed, busy night,  they sell all the beer in the house, and everybody's happy to drink vodka and gin.<br>   <dD>   Having a bar 50 meters from your front door is kind of  like having too much chocolate in the house. I find myself in Drum whenever my mood swings in any direction and sometimes just because I'm bored. It's what a good bar should be: cheap, sexual, and disarmingly unpretentious. Probably the best thing about Drum is that you don't have to smoke if you are having a Nic-fit. There's no ventilation and the ceiling is only 7 or 8 feet tall. So on a busy night, the air in the place is as thick as fog. It's not for the timid or the weak at heart. The place has balls.<br>    <dd>  On this funky Monday, I find Kara and Biser hanging out on bar stools. There's something heavy in the air between them, and I can't put my finger on it. I slither over to the bar to buy a beer instead. Beside the cash register, a girl fixes me with undress-me eyes then slips her arm around my waist and plants a soft kiss on me. Were there introductions that I missed at some point? After some flirtatious talk, her name floated up. Nadia had sex boiling off her skin like spilled perfume. Straight and thin, she's got the body of a 15 year-old with the wicked smile of a middle aged vixen. Suddenly, all my lonely frustrations had found an answer: a nubile Kate Moss to soothe my ego. After a few minutes she drifted off to talk to friends, and I return to the weird energy of Kara and Biser.<br>    <dd>  While Biser is talking to a friend, Kara tells me that he's been flirting with a girl at the next table, that she just found out that she's pregnant, and that she's going to get really drunk and beat him to a bloody pulp. All this comes out in a frustrated burst of non-stop cursing, and I'm left flabbergasted. Biser? The big lug who was drinking himself into a coma because Kara was going to Greece for a week? Nothing to do but shrug in a friendly way and buy her another drink even though she's already blowing in the wind. Nadia waves at me from the "dance floor" (a wide aisle between tables), and after a few minutes she's doing the Limbo...grinding her groin against me while leaning back into a 90 degree angle. It's bizarrely sensuous because I can't grind back against her without knocking her off-balance. I find myself shooting smirks over at Morrison's rock-god poster.<br>  <dd>    Later, it becomes obvious that Kara's accusations are on the money. Biser is sitting at another table, nuzzling an over-dressed local girl. Kara is boiling over. "You can't tell me it's just because he's drunk! He's an asshole! And I'm...," she chokes it off with a big slug of Vodka. Bad scene. She's about to fall off her bar-stool, and Biser is stumble drunk and groping a cheapy. Thinking about the pregnancy bit, I'm suddenly enraged. Rushing over, I wack his huge shoulder. "What are you doing, Biser! What are you doing? Kara is very sad!"<br>    <dd>  He looks up at me, suddenly confused and hurt, like a young child. "Krees. I no understand." He mumbles something with the same pained look. All there is to do is walk away. Nadia returns for more flirtatious dancing, and after awhile, she delivers my escape from the painful Kara situation. She wants me to walk her home, since she is alone.<br>    <dd>  It's a cool, clear night, with a sky full of stars and no one but us on the streets. Nadia tells me she's from Pleven, a town close to the Danube. She's studying at the "U-Z" (S'Western University, here in Blagoevgrad).  After a big kiss in the middle of the street, she looks at me quietly. "Do you want me, Krees?" Yes...Do you want me? "I want you, but I have boyfriend in Pleven." Suddenly she bursts into tears on my shoulder, and cries with her head buried in my leather jacket for several minutes. I'm speechless. After wiping her blood-shot eyes, she bums a cigarette.<br>   <dd>   She smokes silently, and I lean on a streetpost to stare at the buildings and stars, the streets with the first layer of autumn leaves, the blossoming plume of smoke she sends out of her small mouth. It's another moment of strange comfort in a strange moment that eludes any capturing. Time collapses and I'm laughing drunk in Austin alleyways with Joseph Pettyjohn; staring across the empty Texas void with Silvia, telling her of a childhood spent in dust storms and hog-lots; spitting poetry in the run-down "Chicago House" with the blooming young poetress Tricia (when will she publish that book?); standing alone in the shadow of Miner's Needle, watching moonrise in the Arizona desert.<br>      <dd>   "I've seen things you people would never understand. Attack ships on fire off the coasts of Orion. I watched sea-beams glitter in the dark outside the Tenhauser gates! And all these moments...will be lost...in time...like tears...in rain..."<br>         <center>           (--Roy  Batty's last words, "BladeRunner").</center>    <dd>  The rest of the way to Nadia's apartment, I'm humming Counting Crows "Mr. Jones."<br>   <dd>   The apartment is two rooms - a small bathroom, and a bedroom, with 3 beds and 2 other girls sleeping. Everybody wakes up and we chatter at each other for a few minutes, then the lights go off and we slide into bed. I doze off with Nadia's sylph-little body pressed to me like wax around a mold.<br>  <dd>    We're the last to wake in the morning, and the roommates are already gone. While she showers, I stand on the little balcony (almost all apartments in Europe seem to have one of these, so that people can hang out clothes to dry) and look out across part of the city I'd never seen. This is one of the lower to middle class housing zone. It's a stretch of huge, ugly Socialist-era apartment buildings (10+ floors). Between this building and two others is a playground. Grass has been worn away in most spots, and a new fall of yellow leaves covers the ground. I wonder about this life. It's so far from me. The peripheries are touchable, but the heart of it is elusive. Where does hope come from for these people? <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
