French,<BR> <DD>     You've asked a question that is close to my heart. I was bred and born in Rochester, New York, so I've got a pretty good handle on the local area and its varied wildlife. In fact, I used to hang out with the punks down on Monroe Avenue myself about ten years ago. I was one of them, albeit a much younger member of their pack. I stayed around them for several years, and as time passed I noticed my herd was thinning out; I can only imagine how the buffalo must have felt. As we grew older, more and more of my group started "moving to Boston." I was younger than even the youngest members of my herd by at least two years, so when finally the last of my punk clan departed on their spiritual journey to the mystic land of "Boston," I was left stranded in their wake. With none of my peer group left to lead me on the Way of the Punk, I was unable to complete my transmigration into "Boston" and lost out on my chance at ethereal bliss. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.<BR>   <dd>   At this point you're probably saying, "That doesn't answer my question!" You are absolutely correct, it doesn't answer a damn thing, but it is an interesting psychological phenomenon. Anyway, now we know where they go, the mythical punk graveyard if you will. They must be stacked eight deep in the streets of "Boston" by now.<br>    <dd>  So where do they come from? I can only assume the answer from my own experiences within the drove. As our pack thinned, another herd began to form. It consisted entirely of middle schoolers in the pupa stage of punkdom, otherwise know as new wavers. Their cluster continued to increase, eventually achieving critical mass and assuming our old roles as our own dwindling numbers  had left it impossible for us to maintain all of our loitering responsibilities. I believe that what takes place is that Monroe Avenue actually requires a minimum number of punks, as its sentinel of choice, and as the current assemblage begins to taper off, the sheer force of its need for a guardian community eventually begins to transform a few harmless bystanders. The bystanders are already instilled with all it takes to become a punk; they just required the impetus implanted by Monroe Avenue itself to really become true punk rockers.<br>      <dd> So in the end, quite simply stated, punk rockers are drawn to serve Monroe Avenue in the prime of their lives, and as their age increases, they are dispersed to the otherworldly pastures of "Boston" to seize upon their retirement package. For one of my crew this retirement package consisted of finding a stranger's wallet and credit card with which he purchased a life time supply of sweat cloths and large chunky jewelry. I suppose everybody's idea of nirvana is just a little bit different.<br> 		<dd>			-The Bare-foot Girl<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
