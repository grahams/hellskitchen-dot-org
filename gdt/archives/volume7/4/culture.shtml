Previous to the influence of westerners, they lived in the lowlands. The change of environment caused them to switch from a lowland-forest subsistence economy (shifting cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering) and become subsistence agriculturalists (due to the increased population density and depleted resources). Since the mid-twentieth century, Catholicism was introduced and began to be integrated with the traditional belief system. However, the traditional religion stayed fairly intact.
