I, and several people close to me, wish to defend the <I>Reporter</I>.<br>  <dd>   Beginning with the condemnation of the <I>Distorter</I> by RIT's Vice-President, Dr. Stan McKenzie, I watched events with interest. For three years now I have never hesitated to make my opinion regarding the <I>Reporter</I> known, but the ecstatic pleasure at seeing Dr. McKenzie cut down the <I>Reporter</I> was soon replaced with alarm. Many faculty responded to the Vice President's notice with reactionary messages of their own, one going so far as to state that the responsible parties on the <I>Reporter</I> should be expelled.<br> <dd>    The 1997<I> Distorter</I> is one of the better issues of <I>Reporter Magazine</I> I have read in several months. This does not qualify it for any literary laurels, however. Ideas were poorly executed, the prose was unengaging, and the presentation (which I was told was supposed to mock the graphic disaster that passes as a magazine, "<I>RayGun</I>") was typical for the <I>Reporter</I>, complete with obscured content and visually distracting text orientations; in short, it was piss poor.<br>   <dd>  Controversy concerning the publication, instead of focusing of the consistently low quality of material and presentation, centered on the topics which the <I>Reporter</I> chose to satirize. Aiming for "intellectual satire," the <I>Distorter</I> fell short and resorted instead to thinly cloaked attacks on RIT groups and individuals.<br>   <dd>  Regardless of what they wrote or how poorly they executed their ideas, they should not be punished for expressing themselves. The real shame lies not with <I>Reporter Magazine</I>, but with those who take themselves (and a third rate publication) too seriously. If the Distorter were well written and promoted abusive concepts, then it might be considered a threat. Instead, it is a poorly penned, difficult to read publication, briefly mentioning some controversial buzz words (ebonics, downsizing, cloning) aimed at raising the ire of knee-jerk reactionaries.<br>  <dd>   Shame on all of you for falling for it.<br>  <dD>   I stand by the<I> Reporter</I>, whether they want it or not, and defend their right to print what they choose. If, however, the mobs start screaming for the dismantlement of <I>Reporter Magazine</I> based specifically on its substandard writing and inadequate layout, I will be one of the loudest voices screaming to be shown its severed head.<br>    <dd> The role of any publication should be to convey information. When context takes precedent over content, information is intentionally obscured and lost. The publication then has no more sense then Dadaist performance art and should be treated with as much respect.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
