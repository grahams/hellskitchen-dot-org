I want to find passion in my life. Periodically I will have a brief brush with passion (I am not talking about sex, eroticism, or passion specifically. Just fire; desire to do something). More often I have bouts of amusement with myself or the antics of others, but these bouts are evanescent. One of the troubles with trying to enact this change is even finding the desire to look for desire.<br>   <dd>  I don't know where to start in my mind, so I am starting outside. I am beginning by wearing bright outfits all the time (the types of colours you only see on children between the ages of two and six...and on fade-resistant detergent commercials). Some bright colours are very rarely made into clothing, [Editors Note: and rightly so!] so it is helpful that I can sew. Now I have pants in safety orange, screaming chartreuse, and red velure. I guess there isn't a very large market for such garish things, but ya know, they do help. When I wear the safety orange pants I can't help but laugh at myself for how glaringly bright and obnoxious they are.<br>   <dd>   I am also not allowing myself to watch TV unless there is something I specifically want to see. Occasionally I have found myself trapped into watching TV for hours on end. Surfing the channels in the vain hope of finding something mildly amusing with at least a vague haze of intellectual content, merely because I lack motivation. I'm not even talking about the phenomenal act of will necessary to raise my ass from the comfort of my easy chair. I'm talking about the amount necessary to move my finger from the channel to the power button.<br>    <dd>  You know, when the anaesthetic isn't properly injected, sitting glued in front of the flashing electric brain leech can sometimes be depressing and contribute to feelings of uselessness.<br>   <dd>   Additionally, I am not allowed to listen to depressing music to put myself to sleep. I had never realized how much of my music could be termed depressing until I placed this restriction on myself. Most music with lyrics deal with depressing subject matter in some way....<br>  <dd>   Finally, in this initial phase I am also trying to exercise regularly. It may help to increase energy levels and improve the image of my body.<br>   <dd>   I have been struggling with this regimen for almost three weeks now and find myself retreating into reading instead of watching TV...which still leaves me feeling unproductive. I have more fabrics to work with but haven't done any sewing in almost a week.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/erasing.html">Other Erasing Eeyores in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/hd.html">Heather Danielson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
