The primate in him wanted to lower his head...or maybe crap in his hand and throw it at him. Yeah.  Here's poop in yer eye.<br>   <dd>  As the subway thrust its way deeper into the beckoning tunnels of the city, he thought back. If only he had had a club. A baseball bat to erase that foreign sign of respect from the freak's face. Then he wouldn't look anyone in the face again.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images4/1.1.gif"><br>    <dD>   At the next stop, the subway filled up to capacity. It was impossible to escape from brushing against another before, but now circumstances were more intimate. The hand of the leggy woman next to him was against his crotch, and he was alarmed to realize he was getting an erection. It was impossible for the woman not to notice...not unless she had had all of the nerve endings in her hand severed. Still, she did nothing. At the next stop she pushed her way off the subway.<br>     <dd> She never looked anyone in the eye. Slut.<br>     <dd> He was an extra. An extra person in the drama of the life of someone else. His was nothing but a walk-on role. Just another of the crushing masses that would live an unremarkable life, not because he did not have talent or aspirations, but because there were so many people with talent and aspiration. He, and everyone else, was fodder. God fodder. Well, not for much longer. He would make them all know who he was. Just wait until that mail order blimp arrived....</I><p>  <dd>    Look to your right. Now your left. How many people do you see? Too many! The multitude of inhabitants on this planet is growing tempestuously, and unless we want to imitate the local white-tailed deer population with a huge quantity of emaciated individuals on the side of the thoroughfare (and deceased, often dismembered, ones in the middle), we had better start dreaming up something drastic to do that will help alleviate this problem. Oh wait, there already are malnourished multitudes in the streets... anyone want to recommend reintroducing the indigenous predators (i.e. muggers, wolves, serial rapist/killers), or organizing a hunting trip into the neighborhoods? We can all head down to the regional venery emporium, buy some semi-automatic projectile armaments smuggled in from China via their new California naval base, don our hunter-orange suit jackets and Hush Puppies, and start perforating the pates of the unsuspecting droves of "sapients" gushing out of gloomy theatres after the six hours they just exhausted being pent up watching all of the re-released Star Wars movies in one sequential sitting. It would be glorious, wouldn't it?<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images4/1.2.gif"><br>    <dd>  "There's Homer Simpson. And there's Homer Simpson!"<br>   <dD>   Florida, apart from recently setting their latest champion of the anabaric throne on fire and being the geriatrial apothecary head of the union, has recently attempted the first option enumerated by releasing a substantial number (some multiple of the number ten beginning with the number 3) of condemned criminals from their state penitentiaries. Though there are certainly going to be a massive quantity of maimed and murdered people not running about any more, killing mature members of society is just medicating the syndrome. We need to cease new progeny from being born.<br>     <dd> China is doing its part to limit births...why can't you? It's time to spur up good old fashioned Red Fever and try to show the world that whatever They&#153; can do, we can do better. Partial Birth Abortions (PBA, not to be confused with the PTA: Parent Teachers Association) is a promising beginning - it's certainly more entertaining than other methods - but it isn't really much of an effective birth deterrent; it's actually closer to a spectator sport. Sell tickets to the procedure and have judges. It would be like the oyster shucking competitions that are held in the south: see which medical practitioner could crack open the skulls and devoid them of the developed and functional cerebellums of the luckless feti the fastest. You can't buy publicity like that.<br>   <dd>   Then again, there are so many other potential ways of limiting global population... even after you neglect sterilization and outright war (since we've been doing those for centuries and it doesn't seem to work. Personally, I think China and India could really help each other out by cutting loose on one another. One year of serious infantry battle in the Himalayas and between the weapons and the elements the world population would be cut in half and the standard of living in both countries would be significantly better. While we're at it, let's introduce Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease into the holy cows of India. Get rid of the poor starving creatures once and for all); it's time we started getting creative. GDT is now prepared to unveil a "modest proposal" of its own.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images4/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>    Taxes.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a>  Oh yes! Let's put a tax on tykes. Your first child is free (and the second one's by me), but as soon as you have a second child, the government comes a-knocking on your door and taxes your ass (well, your child's ass, and other appropriate body parts)...more or less depending on how many extra asses you produce. Each additional child increases your tax exponentially. In this new scenario children become symbols of exaggerated wealth in society. <br><dd>   "Yeah did you hear? The Wilsons are having a third! They must not want that new condo in the Hamptons."<br>   <dd>    Can't pay for your kiddies? Guess what...you go to jail. That's right, one all-expenses-paid tour of your county jail where you can relax with your new friends Bubba and Sammy the Sodomite following an enjoyable day of mandatory manual labor.  Once your accounts are settled, Junior is returned: hardly the worse for his stay with his Big Brother. Sure he twitches during the day and screams all night long, but you can rest assured in the knowledge that you didn't do it.<br>    <dd>   The perks would just keep right on coming in the new atmosphere of the Defensive Tyke Tax (DTT, not to be confused with DDT, the Defensive Dyke Tax. That is something totally different being proposed by the Right side of Congress). For people who desire children, but not the monetary hassle, new businesses will spring up around a rent-an-offspring mentality (a boon to the American pedophile population, and, for the first time in probably nine centuries, choir boys may be allowed a small respite). Another added benefit is that there would be fewer cases of children having children, because any parent who couldn't afford another child, would be keeping their precious ones under lock and key until they were old enough to make productive members of society out of themselves. On the other hand, the mafia could threaten people under their protection with raping their daughters and thus forcing them to pay higher premiums on their taxes if they don't conform with the local mafia's plans.<br>    <dd>   "Beautiful daughter you have there, Mr. Santiny. Be a real shame if she fell in love and had a beautiful baby girl. Real shame...."<br>  <dd>    Imagine the increase of  black market children (particularly those disturbing monopeds) and an increased number of parents selling their little darlings into child pornography rings to avoid being sent to the state penitentiary for tax infractions. Investors in Bangkok are just quivering in anticipation.<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images4/1.4.gif"><br>   <dd>   Not only would "parent"  become a more heavily-contemplated title, but the decision to become a Godparent wouldn't be taken as casually. Prospective godparents would have to think, "Sure, Rusty's a great drinking pal, but what if he's a deadbeat by next March? Do I really want his kids?" Answers such as "Hell no!" and, "Not for the love of Sweet Jesus!" (Mmm, Sweet Jesus.... Aagggggrgrgrrgrggrrrrr....) spring to mind.  Child-bearing couples would be pariahs of their social set. Imagine: the Joneses walking into a lively cocktail party. Mrs. Jones is wearing a dazzling evening gown made of silk with skillful renderings of all ten children embroidered into the sumptuous fabric. Someone whispers "breeders," and every one of the socialites present falls silent in the wake of this parental power-house. They all begin to contemplate their napkins with a Zen-like concentration.<br>      <dd>   Although you may find yourself shunned by your less economically productive friends, any and all children formed from your union can rest assured that they were either really wanted in the first place or they were used as some warped means of getting back at those aforementioned Joneses. If you don't end up having a continuing union and your child becomes split between parents, then you'd both have to pay proportional amounts of the tax to maintain it until it becomes an economically independent participant in the society.<br>    <dd>  Trust us, it would work. There are no drawbacks. Besides, our recommendations are at least as logical as encouraging couples to have nine children that they can't afford to feed, clothe, or educate.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A>This is a new version of taxation which is temporarily dubbed the Preventative Progeny Program of Assessment.
