I mean, you walk into this place and there is only seating on the right and the far right, IF you know what I mean, AND I think you do. As I was leaving, the parking lot was jammed with people trying to do the same.  So I wondered if these born-again fundys would have the same "fuck the other driver as hard and as often as possible" attitude in a church parking lot on Easter that so often prevails in Rochester (major sporting events, RPO concerts, Wegmans' parking lots).  Surely they couldn't be so cutthroat?  And sure enough as I pulled out I noticed an orderly merging pattern into the main traffic stream, alternating one car from my line with one car from another.  I was pretty impressed!  Until it got to my turn and Mr. Jackass followed so closely to the car having its rightful turn that he simply burned the excess gas from the first guy's exhaust. Apparently he could see the bar code 666 of my unwashed heathenness through my windshield, and took his right(ful/eous) turn. Nice guy.  FOR ME TO POOP ON! <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rae.html">Other Random Acts of E-Mail in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
