He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.   Feel free to email him at CPL960@JMC.AUBG.BG <br></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8>November 27th, 1996<br><dd>   One of those crazy days, running all day to meet a deadline that I've been putting off. Had to design some shit-stupid pamphlet to attract American students to AUBG. I decide to take the low road and throw in a few screaming slogans like:<br>  <dd>    LAST NIGHT I BOUGHT A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL!!! WOW! BULGARIA IS LIKE VEGAS ON ACID!<br>     <dd> Why not appeal to the basest of American desire? Seems to work quite well for Bangkok, so why not Bulgaria, where there is a surplus of humanity and a shortage of reason and resource. Finally, by 6 PM, I can sit down for breakfast followed by a frantic 4 hours of sleep.<br>   <dd>   It's the 2nd night of my radio show, and since I didn't have a title for the show last week, I decide to tell Blagoevgrad that they are listening to "The Untitled Alternative." This week I've thrown the play-list out the window and brazenly barged ahead with a slew of tracks that are over-known in America and never-heard in Bulgaria. Great fun doing your own radio show. Imagine snarling meanly along w/ Johnny Rotten ("...so Fuck You, we're the Future, your future...God Save the Queen, it's a fascist regime!") while queuing up whatever the hell you feel like following it with. All this for the education of Bulgarian youth, who I've been told are beginning to tune into the show just for a break from a mish-mashed re-run of too many Phil Collins remixes of the same song. Education? Call it indoctrination.<br>    <dd>  It's hardly seems an accident that AUBG has chosen to set up in the vacated halls of the Bulgarian Communist Party Headquarters for the Pirin sector of the country. Quite fitting when you think about it: one indoctrination machine leaves the awkwardly over-designed squat structure only to be quickly replaced by it's nemesis, an American University. It's an anthropological fact that time and time again victorious cultures will build new religious edifices on the sites of the destroyed temples of the defeated faith. And who would deny that economic systems are a form of 20th Century religion? And now rather than spouting nationalist marching tunes or brassy-voiced pronouncements, the radio facility of the building is pumping out my personal version of American youth music. At least it's music made for and by frustrated people searching for better answers to the questions their parents either overlooked or choked. But all in all that's only an excuse for my particular brand of propaganda music, isn't it?<br>   <dd>   As I'm running low on material, I am sweating and nervous by 2 am, as I'd had to dig madly through thousands of CD's to find the last 1/2 hour worth of indoctrination. Emerging from the studio, I find Vlad and Karina waiting smiley faced and waxy to offer me a congratulatory drink on this Thanksgiving morning. I'm really touched by their gesture, although I'm quite sure that the tall, pimply-faced Byelorussian would have found another way to shepherd his nervously thin (how many times a month does she change her hair color?) "Romanian conquest" to some quiet bar where he could pump enough liquor into her veins to strip her inhibitions and later her body. Over beers in the Drum, Vladimir once betrayed his personal goals to me as his broad lipped smile exposed a big toothy grin: "You see Chris, I'm a sexual Imperialist. A year ago I decided to, conquer a woman from every nation of the Earth." He's doing a good job of it, as I know he can already pencil off Belarus, America, Albania, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Romania at the ripe age of 19.<br>    <dd>  Karina guides us to Bar Milena, a non-stop that has low lighting and relaxed ambiance without a crowd of cigarette-waving teenagers. A few tables of men hunching secretly over beers (as if they are discussing state secrets) are scattered across the place, but it's principally ours. The waiter glides over with the silent grace of a man who's been pulling the night-shift for so long that 2 am feels to him like 9 am does to me: cool and quiet, a time of day filled with self-satisfied reflection and steaming tea cups. Our order is complicated and we edit it several times before refining it to simple things. Vodka for the Byelorussian, brandy and blueberry juice for the Carpathian Romanian, gin for the American. As he sets down the glasses, I feel like we're some UN gathering, with representative drinks on the table rather than national flags. It's a great wandering conversation that starts with Vlad telling me how cool it was to play Sonic Youth on the show and ends with Karina expounding on the virtues of Philip K. Dick. In between, a table of people I don't pay any mind to arrive and leave from the next table. Somewhere in the twisted conversational lines I remarked about how I was relishing having "Balkan" experiences like being crowded into a sweaty train without water or screwing a girl as quietly as possible while my roommate stares at the wall and acts like he's asleep. After another long bout of laughter, Karina remarks that Vlad (she calls him "Vova", which I can't bring myself to use since I'm afraid I might say "Vulva" by accident) never lets her sleep earlier than 5 in the morning. Ah yes, the girl says it's time to go home.<br>     <dd> As Vlad and Karina shrug themselves into their coats and scarves, I stare incredulously at the bare chair back that was once graced with my leather jacket. Having something extremely personal stolen from you feels like you've just lost a sibling or an organ. I'm not attached to objects much, and rarely spend more than a few seconds of regret on the loss of one at the hands of a crafty thief. But this jacket has protected my skin from crazy years of motorcycle wrecks (I have very fond memories of the exhilarating split second before a machine passes it's center of gravity and spills the rider onto a frantically stationary stretch of mean-toothed asphalt.), bar tussles, and drunken falls from tree-branches. Beautiful women have buried their faces into it's soft, pungent folds and unloosed torrents of warm tears. It's been a make-shift pillow at the end of many nights of homeless sleeping. And one frosty winter night it saved me from frostbite while I tried to get un-lost in a very bad Toronto neighborhood. This jacket was simply put, my best friend. And now it'll be worn by some chic Bulgarian mafioso who'll use it to cock a Western cool in sleazy cafes that stink of too much tobacco while he chats up women with too much make-up and not enough brains to see that he's just another hustler.<br>   <dd>   After a few minutes of mourning, Vlad smiles sheepishly and says "Well, I guess you've just had a Balkan experience...". I imagine the brave thief looking back at the balding American kid he's just stolen a very valuable piece of cow hide from, and thinking to himself, "Happy Thanksgiving, Motherfucker!"<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
