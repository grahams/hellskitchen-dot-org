Oh well...maybe I'm just being a little too revealing.<br>  <dd>    Pro-lifers (to be confused with "lifers") have the unique distinction of being able to distinguish between the ideas of "life" and "efil." When shooting doctors and receptions or blowing up the odd clinic (or in rare cases the even clinic), these right-to-lifers (who often have a right to life without parole after such extracurricular activities) can rest assured that they never took a "life" no matter how many smelly old corpses eventually pile up.<br>   <dD>   Efil is not a state of non-life so much as it is the inverse of life (actually being efil is quite a lot like being knurd, with not quite as much of an overhang the morning before). Doctors, nurses, receptionists, and any other walking piles of cellular material that enjoy hanging out in abortion clinics are always honored with the existence of efil. Incidentally, most used-carsalesmen, crossing guards, and male students of the art of cuisine are also quite prone to being efil; they usually catch it in their early teens.<br>  <dd>   As any pro-lifer on the witness stand will tell you, you can't take what someone doesn't have.<br>  <dd>   Now, if you are ever in the mood to go on a killing frenzy of your own, it is probably safest to go after the abortion clinics. However, if you are in a more daring mood,  you probably won't get in too deep if you plant a used car bomb...just make sure that the salesman has real shiny teeth.<br> <dd>    -The Bare-foot Girl<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
