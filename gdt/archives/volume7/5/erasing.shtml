I possess my own personal supply of gen-x apathy. One of the things I am trying to accomplish in this reprogramming is to create an impermeable containment unit for this torpor. As long as the containment unit keeps leaking this toxic indifference into my being, I will keep slipping up.<br>  <dd>   Some days I continue my reprogramming by pretending to care about it. If pretending gets me to actually bother doing the activity, then there is no actual difference in my performance than did I truly care. If I just don't give myself time to think about whether I care or not, I am more apt to accomplish the goals then when I  allow myself time to justify my inaction.<br> <dd>    Every day I struggle to begin my activities. If I postpone my exercise at the beginning of the day, dredging up the motivation to get dressed and go running can be a nearly insurmountable challenge, not to mention the bother of when I ate last and whether it will end up on the side of the road. When I set my alarm early enough to allow time for running before everything else I need to do, I generally will go, for I am a member of that rare and often hated breed: the morning person. Let me try to settle that bile you feel burning its way up your throat. I am not a part of the most repulsive and commonly recognized variety of morning people. You know, the ones who have a glowing smile and are bubbling over with inane banter when you drag your sorry ass into school/work in the morning. The ones who nauseate you to the point where you contemplate vomiting on them to see if that will get them to shut up. I am not that. My variety is far more elusive and less offensive. If you were to spend the night with one of us, you might wake to find breakfast waiting for you or the person finishing the book from your night stand (Oh shit, I just realized that if I successfully reprogram myself, I may switch allegiances. The changes may cause me to evolve (devolve) into the other type of morning person).<br>   <dd>  Once I do start an activity on a given day it doesn't take that much extra energy to see it to completion. For me, running doesn't feel bad, and I do like to sew. It is just that far less effort is necessary to simply keep reading than to sew or run or go into the studio. I have plenty of lazy time in my life, but some days a bit of passion or drive will surface. On those days you just need to stay out of my way. One morning last week I ran three miles and made a dress before going in to class in the morning, had a full day of classes and went dancing that night. I really want to have a higher percentage of days like that.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/erasing.html">Other Erasing Eeyores in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/hd.html">Heather Danielson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
