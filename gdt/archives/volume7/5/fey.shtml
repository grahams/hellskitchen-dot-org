After a week of beautiful weather that had begun to make me forget that 90% of the year Rochester is either too wet or too windy for me, the local geography came to its senses and walloped me with rain.<br>   <dd>  Driving through the rain was further complicated by the night. Wipers slashing madly at the unrelenting deluge, I couldn't help but start humming a song buoyed up from the depths of my childhood:With the window-wipers/Taping out the tempo/Keeping perfect rhythm/With the song on the radio/Got to keep moving.<br> <dd>    Or something like that.<br>   <dd>  I slowly pulled up to an intersection and stopped, obliged to wait for the light to change in my favor. As suddenly as it began, the rain stopped, leaving a auditory vacuum in its wake.<br>   <dd>   Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a movement in the street. Under the jaundiced streetlights, I saw a small bird flopping in the road. After a moment, I identified it confidently as a Wiggle-Butt bird.<br>    <dd> Last year, my roommate had found a small sparrow that had somehow fallen out of its nest. Bringing it back to our apartment, we proceeded to nurse it back to health. Annoying at first, the incessant peeps grew endearing, particularly when the small creature would laboriously work its way across the living room floor just to lay itself next to you and sleep. The thing that impressed me, however, was the apparent never ending gyrating it would do. Whether hungry, thirsty, content, or just sleepy, the little bird's butt was always moving.<br>   <dd>  After a few weeks, she had grown strong enough that she was beginning to experiment with flight. Leaping about like spring activated toy, she seemed particularly fond of throwing herself into the air and madly flapping trying to reach my roommate or I. It was decided that, since we had already been teaching her how to search for food in the grass, it was nearing time to let her know that she was expected to leave soon.<br>   <dd>  The night before letting her go, she slept in my room because there was a nest of sparrows outside my window that I thought she would enjoy hearing. When I returned home from school that afternoon, I discovered her near my closet door. Asking whether she had had a nice day, and whether she was hungry, I approached. She lay with her legs straight out behind her. Bending down, I did a quick check: she had broken her neck. From what I could tell, she had heard the other birds sometime during the day and got so excited, flew into my closet door in her attempt to get to them.<br>   <dd>   So sitting at that light in the aftermath of the rainstorm, I saw a Wiggle Butt bird fluttering in the street. I assumed it had been unfortunate enough to be caught in the storm and was too wet to fly. If it stayed where it was, a car would surely hit it.<br>  <dd>    As I began to undo my seatbelt, intent on helping move the bird out of the street, I saw the bird thrust itself into the sky...and become a leaf. After 4 years in the Biology department, I'm pretty sure I can tell a bird from a leaf. Inbetween blinks of the eye, a sorry looking wet bird became a leaf that was blown lazily away by a passing breeze.<br> <dd>    Of course it could have been a leaf the entire time. All those feathers and apparent weight as it crashed back to the road only tricks of the light and mind. Upon relating the story to Andrea Chrisman one of the minds behind the Iconoclast and a Believer, she simply said that maybe someone was trying to tell me something.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <IMG width = 500 align = center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/logos/trees.gif"><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
