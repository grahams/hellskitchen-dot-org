Thankfully they don't play "Wipe Out," but I think they could expand another decade to include Herbie Hancock's "Rocket" and the classic "Miami Vice Theme."  Anyway, I listened to it all the way home, turning the radio off in the middle of a song.  When I got back in the car some 7-8 hours later, I turned on the radio to hear the same song that I had shut off before, picking up right where it left off!  Now, as a trumpet player, I'm contractually obligated to have a big head, but I was never sure until that moment that the world revolved around me (I know, you've been trying to tell me this for years)!  Imagine a radio station caring enough to stop and start broadcasting according to when I was in my car!<p> 	<dd>	-- Markra (more relation to Mothra than Mithra)<p> P.S.  From now on I will be counting the hairs in my brush every morning to divine Hell's Kitchen production schedules.  I will be obeyed!<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rae.html">Other Random Acts of E-Mail in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
