He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

She's studying literature here at AUBG because she's passionate about it; a very brave move in a country with 300% inflation.  Freely admitting that her only hope is to receive a large enough scholarship to go to an American grad school, she told me that she knew her hopes were probably in vain but that she couldn't give up on her greatest love.  This semester she took 18 hours of courses, and because of the crunch at finals, she presented identical papers to two different professors.  But she was very proud of this paper and didn't feel that she was doing any wrong, mostly because this sort of thing had never been addressed in conversations concerning "academic dishonesty."  The department noticed and had punished her by giving her an F in one class and forbidding her to repeat the class.  Further, they said that they would be forced to mention this incident in the recommendations she would ask of them when she began applying to grad schools.  It seemed a mirror of modern Bulgaria.<br>    <dd>  Later she told me a story from her childhood:<br>   <dD>   "I was in a special youth brigade; all of us had a youth brigade when we were young.  My brigade was the Rose Brigade.  In the summer we harvested the roses. We would get on the buses at 4 AM and arrive at the fields very early, maybe 4:30, because they wanted us to start picking the roses before the sun came up.  The fields were huge lines of rose bushes, and we had special uniforms with high boots to keep the dirt and mud from getting all over us.  Some days they wanted us to pick 20 kg of rose petals in one day.  The roses were wet with dew, and slippery, and it was dark.  You would find the blossoms by touch, and all around were many voices; we would all chat and talk in the dark.  It was still cold in the mornings and the dew would cover my fingers and arms and it was so chilly to be wet.  But we would talk and make little jokes to keep each other company, and really it was such fun.  As the sun would begin to come up, we could see the huge fields of roses with the sun rising before us, and it was so beautiful.  It would begin to become warm and as the bushes dried, the thorns would tear my uniform and cut my hands, because you see, they don't cut you when they are wet, only when they are dry.  When it became hot, the insects would come out and we would be covered with insects and sometimes bitten by wasps.<br>  <dd>    "But when we came back to our dormitories, all of our clothes would smell of roses, and it was even deep in your skin, the smell of roses.  We were young, maybe 14 or 15, and they kept the boys and girls separated.  But at night we had a special organized disco, beside a small building, with just a big tape player.  And we would dance with the boys, all of us shy and smelling like roses.<br>   <dD>   "I remember the time of Communism, and it was so different.  Maybe because I was just a child I  couldn't see that it wasn't working, but I always felt so secure.  I wasn't afraid to walk at night because there was no crime and we had no fear of each other.  People had so many different friendships then.  And now it's all so different, we are all so divided, and struggling and competing against each other. And there is so little opportunity that we are all reaching for it at once.  But I remember Communism as being a very happy time, and now things are so different and people are so scared."<br>  <dd>   There was an awesome silence, after which she glanced at her watch and said "Oh, I have to catch my bus to the dormitory."  Walking her to the bus stop, my mind was flooded with images of wide-eyed young teenagers dancing in a shy cloud of rose perfumes.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
