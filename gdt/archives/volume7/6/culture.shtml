Their numbers have grown from 9750 in 1938 to over 25,000 in 1990. Despite the difficult terrain, automobile roads like all Andian villages. They are agriculturists and extremely active in trading with neighboring villages.<p><UL><LI><B>More fun with midgets:</B> The Andis believe in a community of souls, who are miniature beings. These tiny people must be appeased with gifts from the Andis.<LI><B>Belief most likely to be used as a plot for "The X-Files":</B> Invisible dopplegangers act out the lives of Andi people. What happens to each person is merely a reenactment of their doppleganger's earlier actions. A person's doppleganger abandons him or her ten days before death.<li><B>More fun than watching ER:</B> Occasionally, the Andis have been known to practice a wonderful medical technique called trephination.
