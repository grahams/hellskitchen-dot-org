Each week on the <I>Shabbes</I>, I see crowds of God's Groupies walking to and from their local shul (because it's against the <I>mitzvahs</I> to drive there, silly). Cute Jewish girls in their pretty dresses; older, more orthodox men wearing black and earlocks galore. Becoming accustomed to walking along busy city streets, they have banded into groups for mutual protection. Utilizing elaborate methods of defense and impressive strategic patterns when threatened,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> they put the Shriners in their silly little go-carts to shame.<br><dd>  Last Friday, I was standing on a street corner, idly watching a crowd of Chosen amble towards the Temple down the road, when some goyish strangers came around the corner. Those with the Holy Mitochondria silently arranged themselves into a flanked wedge with their hands in their coat pockets. With growing dread I just knew they were fondling their <I>matzoh-stars</I>,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> keeping the deadly little weapons at the ready.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/1.1.gif"><br><dd>   What the blissfully ignorant gentiles never realized was that they had just crossed paths with one of the more aggressive Jewish gangs: the Kosher Club. Being able to walk away from an encounter with the Kosher Club is lucky indeed. The strangers, undoubtedly on their way to the Catholic Store, never even knew how fortunate they were that it was the Sabbath.<br>    <dd> In recent years, Americanized Jews have been forced to adopt more street culture than any family could hope to support, let alone feed and educate. Starting with the conflicts between the Hasidic enclave in Brooklyn, New York and their Hispanic and African neighbors in the fall of 1990, many Jews have begun to join various gangs for protection; a menorah Jewish Grandmothers (gaggle of geese, murder of crows, menorah of Jews. What, you think we make this shit up?) is almost guaranteed to make any would-be assailants think twice.<br>   <dd>   "Have you eaten? You look so thin! You remember Mrs. Lebowitzch...."<br>   <dd>   Calling upon the Protocols of Zion and employing Deutemoronic methods, Jewish Gangs are finding the best way to be a righteous people and live by God's commandments...all 613 of them. <br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>  Unfortunately, what began as a symbol of solidarity in Jewish communities has splintered into several competing factions. Recognized as the toughest gang is the Satmarer. Unlike other groups that display their gang allegiance by the colour of their <I>kippah</I>, the Satmarer retain the distinctive dress of their Hungarian origins, wearing their peyes in full view, while the women shave their heads showing they are ready for combat, if necessary. Although less intimidating than the Satmarer, the 4H Club,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a> Lubavitch, and WB are all powerful forces in modern American cities, enforcing the <I>mitzvahs</I> on the streets, advancing the art of bickering over prices in the market place, and occasionally clashing over turf.<br><dd>  The Jews,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a> repressed for centuries, have been forced to develop an entire arsenal of weapons meant specifically to lull the goyim into a false sense of security. Take for example, the <I>matzoh-stars</I>: fun, crunchy snacks for children, but when in the hands of the wily orientally-trained Master Ninja Jews...deadly weapons. It's all in the follow-through. Rest assured, however, the unleavened bread that may take your life is kosher <I>l'pesah</I>. <br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/1.3.gif"><br><dd>     Only the most pacifistic people of God would ever consider leaving their protective abodes without a few cleverly concealed <I>matzos-stars</I>, but there are other effective armaments to be had. For instance, the spring-loaded steel-rimmed <I>kippah</I>. Though they can't be used on Saturdays due to the mechanical mechanisms contained in the set-up, the steel-rimmed <I>kippahs</I> themselves are not mechanical in origin. So on the occasion of the sabbath, special stackable <I>kippahs</I> (SSKs) are available. They're not quite as technologically advanced, but their functionality is undeniable. When you've used your first one, you will still find five or six more killer <I>kippahs</I> stacked beneath it. The only important point to make note of is that you must have already stacked these on your head by Friday at sunset, because once the big bright one hits the deck you are not allowed to do any work. The inherent instability of <I>kippah</I> in flight, however, limits their effectiveness.<br> <dd>    By far the most dangerous weapon of the Jewish gangs is the <I>dreidel</I>. Where the Yo-yo was once a weapon used by the Philippinos, the top-like <I>dreidel</I> has come to be much more than a child's toy. Now, children with <I>dreidels</I> are actually practicing for their future place in gangs.<br>   <dd>  The <I>dreidel</I> used by the gang members look very similar to those found in the hands of the young. Referred to as "spinning dreidels of death," these joys are edged with diamond and sharpened on the folded tongues of at least ten mother-in-laws. The best <I>dreidel</I> slingers can actually create an audible whine from the twirling of the horrible weapons. At up to 10,000 rpms, many potential conflicts between antagonistic gangs have been defused by the sudden high whine of <I>dreidel</I>-packing Jews, warning the other group of their imminent peril. The only effective defense to the ungodly mess that a well-aimed <I>dreidel</I> can inflict are <I>challah</I> shields. Skillfully used to deflect the weapons rather than simply stop them, these bready saviors are worn over the back in the fashion of a quiver of arrows and double as field rations.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/1.4.gif"><br>  <dd>   Of course, there are times when conflict can not be avoided, and the air is filled with <I>matzos-stars</I>, bladed <I>kippahs</I>, and <I>dreidels</I> humming down the sidewalk, embedding in the sides of buildings, trees, and the occasional fowl hanging in a store front window. Even when retreating from such a fearful barrage, there are terrors. Hidden in the streets and under sidewalks are anti-personnel <I>kniche</I>. One wrong step and you're a kosher meal. In response to the growing gang activity, the rabbi of various communities have organized riot control groups, armed with quantum <I>challah</I> body armor and rubber <I>gefelte-fish</I> bazookas.<br>   <dd>   A rigorous regiment of Kosher Killing Calisthenics and hard street experience, the life of a Jewish gang member is far from easy, but that's ok! They're Jews and are used to suffering. Unlike their <I>goyish</I> counterparts, the Jewish gangs have the restrictions of the <I>Shabbes</I> to contend with. Unable to work, drive automobiles, or hunt between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday, planning is a necessity. During the week in general, there are few clashes between groups, as their members are usually out making vast amounts of money and undermining the American way of life. As the Sabbath approaches, however, the gangs begin to get itchy for a fight.<br><dd>    Friday is typically a day of preparation, planning during the day for any unforeseen incidents that may occur during the holy sabbath. A Jew in the wrong neighborhood on Friday could find himself in quite a bind. Thanks to the distinctive colours of the gangs and the braided threads in their earlocks, they are easily recognized. The braver gangs will intentionally get trapped in enemy neighborhoods after sundown, confident that they will not be attacked and knowing they are provoking a rumble in the near future. Taking advantage of the situation, gangs behind enemy lines often take up a chant that can send chills down the spines of people in the area. Said by an entire gang, the Gregorian-esk sound travels far and announces to the neighborhood:<br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/1.5.gif"><br> <dd> <B>Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,<br><dd>	I made you out of clay.<br> <dd>    Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,<br><dd>	With you we all will play.</B><p><dd>    After a whole day of being unable to strike out at their enemies (and prayer), Saturday night is rumble time and the gangs explode in immense displays of violence. Few Gentiles have ever seen the secretive clashes of the Jews. Often, furious battles last no more than five minutes. In that time, the air filled with <I>matzos-meal</I> smoke screens and the deadly whine of dreidels can create a surrealistic image in the jaundiced street lights. When the unleavened bread finally settles, there is little to attest to the fact that there had been such a venting of aggression. Bodies have been spirited away as though by the Destroyer, and spent weapons are mysteriously absent...save for the stray <I>dreidels</I> that baffled Christians on their way to Church the next morning find embedded in trees.<br>   <dD>  Where their conflicts had been limited to fighting with other Jewish factions, Hispanics, Italians, and Africans, feeling that their inherent right to gang activity is being infringed upon, have begun to strike into Jewish hoods. Their cockiness at fighting the Jews quickly vanished after a few encounters with <I>Stars of David</I> and hollow tipped <I>dreidels</I>, however. Even attacking the Jews on the Sabbath has failed to yield little more than casualties from <I>matzos-meal</I> inhalation...thanks to the Jews use of automated perimeter defenses. Even when other gangs manage to capture and torture a member of a Jewish gang, they find it useless. What does torture mean to a people who have been persecuted for thousands of years?<br>  <dd>   "What? This is a hurting thing? I think you're doing it wrong.

It wasn't until 1994 that the community began to see gang activity. In battles over turf, the 4H Club are well known for singing peculiar battle songs, including "<I>Lom Singen Ciri Bim, Ciri Bom</I>," "<I>Bin ich mir a Schneiderl</I>," and "<I>Mit a Nudl un a Nudl</I>." Though serving little strategic purpose, the singing of the 4H Club in battle serves to confuse enemies and co-ordinate movements of geographically separated divisions.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#131;</A> Not to be confused with J.E.W.S: Jaded European WaifS.<BR><br> </td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/ma.html">Michele Amoruso</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/bl.html">B.J.
