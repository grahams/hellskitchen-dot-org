The mother of God appeared another 17 times over the next six months, and during each visit imparted some tidbit of advice or warning ("...that dress is all wrong for you!"). It was from these miraculous conversations that Bernadette discovered the healing spring of Lourdes, and the world famous shrine eventually came to be built. Bernadette, wanting nothing more than to join the Sisters of Nevers and live out a life of obscurity, had her wish granted when she was 22. Unfortunately for her, one of the "tidbits" passed on to her from <I>most highly favored among women</I> was, "I do not promise you happiness in this world, but in the next." This, of course, came to pass. Bernadette lived her life in the convent in a state of almost constant illness. Nevertheless, she lived to the ripe old age of 35 and was canonized a mere 30 years later.<br>  <dd>   Bernadette's incorrupt body (lovingly coated in a thin layer of wax) lies in a glass casket in the Motherhouse of her order in Nevers, France.<p>  <dd>   You can also visit the Shrine of our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and the healing waters of the spring in Lourdes, France (over 3 million of the faithful, and who knows how many faithless, visit each year). If France is just to far too go, why not visit one of the many shrines dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes in the U.S.? There is one in Euclid, Ohio, and one in Emmitsburg, Maryland.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <table width = 500><tr><td valign = top>	<IMG  width = 250 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images6/martyr.gif"><br><B><center></B>Directions for reaching Euclid, Ohio from Rochester, New York:</center><p>1: Go Southwest on I-490 to I-90 (22.8 miles)<br>2: Go Southwest on I-90(Portions toll) to      Pennsylvania (119.7 miles)<br>3: Go West on I-90 to Ohio (45.7 miles)<br>4: Go Southwest on I-90 (64.3 miles)<br><I>Total distance: 252.5 miles</I><br><dd>Travel arrangements made possible by Charon Travel (a subsidiary of Hell, Inc.)<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/martyr.html"> Other Martyr Logue Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
