He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

While Mira washed in the bathroom I stood bare-chested before the window and looked out at the dawn. Hearing what sounded like a cat meowing, I looked down to see that Borislava was waving and shouting at from the sidewalk. The clerk hadn't even opened the door!<br>   <dd>   Pulling on a flannel, I ran down to the lobby and hammered on the clerk's window. A scrubbly old man with bed-head and sleep in his eyes stumbled out and opened the door, mumbling "Iszvanyate, Gospodin." It's not common that an old man calls a young man Gospodin in Bulgaria, as it means something close to "my Lord."<br>   <dd>   Bori was flushed and cold, beating her hands together as she cursed the clerk. I was starting to feel a little bit sorry, since we were after all the only people in a 100 room hotel. As we rushed up, Bori apologized for not having brought us cups of morning espresso, but as it was 7 AM on Saturday morning, there were no coffee stands open.  After throwing on my over-shirt, I was ready and we ran for the bus stop.<br>    <dd>  The air was cold and crisp, and the grand socialist architecture of Velingrad was somehow strange and empty in the early blue light. We had come from Blagoevgrad the evening before with Bori, who was guiding us to her home town and had promised to take us to some neighboring Pomak villages. After a couple of weeks over haggling about a topic for our independent study project, Mira and I had finally settled on exploring the identity of the Pomak (Pomatsi, plural). These were people who were said to be Bulgarians whose ancestors had been converted to Islam by the Ottomans and had held onto their religion after Bulgaria was liberated.<br>  <dd>    The night before, Bori had arrived at home to find that another relative was visiting and that she was unable to put us up at her family's home. She shrugged, and her deep-set brown eyes moved quickly in her tiny face as she apologized profusely. She had to send us to a hotel, which was very embarrassing, as she had already promised to find us a bed tonight. For a Bulgarian, there were few acts that could be more of a faux pas.<br>   <dd>   The Hotel Zeltnitsa, on the town's main square, was close and cheap (can you imagine paying $1.25 for a double room in a hotel?), although its rooms seemed awfully similar to the Volga dormitory. That evening, we took in the majestically unexciting town. There was nothing much to be said for it. The only thing that impressed me much was the great circular town plaza:  paved with white flagstones, its center was a huge bronze statue of soldiers and workers straining skyward for a proletariat utopia. Each building around it had huge murals on the walls which were filled with chunky, machine-like people moving in streamlined motions. Although it seemed a bit over done on the worker-ethic thing, it was generally a nice center for a town. Thinking of the crisis that was blowing through Bulgaria, I realized that it would be a long, long time before a government would build public works here [Bulgaria] like this again.<br>   <dd>   At the bus station we stamped our feet and tried to keep the early chill out of our shoes. But the bus was toasty with a rich smell of morning milk and bread, and as we climbed up into the twisty Rhodope mountain roads, sleep quickly drifted over me. Bori's insistent voice tumbled me out of my seat and down onto the gravel shoulder a few minutes later.<br>  <dd>    Before us was the shoulder of a mountain, stretching like a thick arm from the road to a rounded promontory on which a cluster of houses surrounded a single white spire. Around the village were sculpted tiers of farmland,  now brown and vacant. It was only 8 AM, and the sun's light was a low cross-beam that caught the mist from our breath as we hiked down the dirt road leading to Sveta Petka. Bori seemed relaxed and confident, but Mira and I were both itchy and unsure. Neither of us had any real idea of what to say or how to begin. I had my camera out, but I worried about what these people would think of its thirsty glass eye.<br>   <dd>   At the edge of the village, we passed a large shed in which we could hear the movement and voices of people working. A short, fair-skinned man came to the door after we knocked, and while Mira and Bori spoke to him, a women with a babushka'd face peer out of the shadows behind him.<br>   <dd>   "Where is there a cafe?" asked Bori. They are all closed for Ramazan! And is the Hojha in the mosque?" Yes, probably.<br>    <dd>  After talking between ourselves, we decided that Ramazan must be Ramadan, but we didn't know what to do as it was so early. The mosque seemed like the best bet. The pristine white tower suggested a humble, perfect dome at its base, but turning the corner in the village center, we found that it graced an average looking Bulgarian-style home. These buildings are generally constructed of brick and covered with white stucco, with red tile roofs.<br>   <dd>   At the door, we found a "shoe room" with a long line of almost-empty shelves.  A young girl peeked out from another room, having heard us come in and stumble about. Her head was wrapped in a brightly colored bandanna that was tied close under her chin. Bright eyes shining inquisitively, she watched us with great surprise. Before she could answer Mira's first question ("Is the Hojha here?"), the door was opened and a small, warm faced man stood behind the girl. His face was filled with smile-wrinkles, and his green eyes shined brightly from his olive skin. Come in! Come in! He stammered. Leaving our shoes behind us, we entered a warm room bright with colorful rugs and yellow, slanting light that cut through the windows.<br>   <dd>   Around us was a cluster of children, pre- to early teens. They held together in a group, like a crowd of excited goats, straining their necks to peer curiously over each other's shoulders. The three young girls all wore brightly colored cloths on their heads, framing their excited faces and causing their blue or green eyes to stand out like little gems. They wore long, colorful dresses whose shape was straight and simple, while the boys dressed like all Bulgarian boys. I had never seen so many fair-skinned, light-eyed children gathered together in all my time in Bulgaria. The Bulgarians are almost all dark-eyed, and mostly olive-skinned.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
