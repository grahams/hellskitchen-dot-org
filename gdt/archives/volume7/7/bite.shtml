They neglected to sufficiently research what the Chinese version of Coca-Cola, actually "Ke-kou-ke-la," translated to. The phrase actually means, "bite the wax tadpole," or even, "female horse stuffed with wax," depending on what region of the country you live in. The company realized its mistake only after several thousand posters had been printed, at which point they decided to spend a considerable amount of time trying to find a more suitable Chinese name. After rummaging through forty thousand more Chinese characters Coke finally settled on a name that translates as, "happiness in the mouth," or "Ko-kou-ko-le."<br> <dd>    Go ahead Mao, bite the wax tadpole! What could happen? You're already dead. Besides nothing worse could happen to either of you for the rest of the day.<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/vis.html">Other visuals in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> <br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size = +1><B>Created by:</B><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
