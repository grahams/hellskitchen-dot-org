Pens, the frilly edges of notebook paper, paper clips, phones. For those of you out there who have never put a paper clip into your mouth--don't. There is something about the shape that allows it to pinch the smallest sections of your tongue. Tiny matter, sure, but it hurts like the devil.<br>   <dd>  When I was younger, so much younger than today, I would vent my pent-up aggression using my mouth. Seething with fury at the sheer injustices of the world, I would wrap my tiny maw around the edge of doorknobs and bite until it hurt. It sounds foolish, I know, but now I get a perverse kind of pleasure out of the knowledge that there are people living in my childhood home and wondering how teeth marks got on all the doorknobs.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images7/1.1.gif"><br>  <dd>   There was also the time I almost broke my jaw on the fat end of a carrot.  I could barely get the whole thing in my mouth, it was so thick, and I had to use my hands to assist in the chewing action.  Yeah, fat carrot ends are hard, but then again, so is life.  If my life had been easy, I might have been overly surprised that I was being battered with the fat ends of a pair of two-foot-long carrots by some hired heavies. But I wasn't. In fact, it seemed like just another day at the gun factory. Under that onslaught of fruit (They are defined as fruit. They don't taste good with cheese), it didn't take long for me to start gibbering and eventually lose all sense of where I am.  A sort of orange hardness wrapped me into a pair of pants and protected me as I faded into unconsciousness.<p>  <dd>   What would you do? You wake up, you're in a checkered room lying on a pile of frozen peas and pearl onions with a bunch of ice cream vendors around you. They're all packing very dangerous looking carrots, and then one says:<br>  <dd>   "You've been our deep,deep cover operative-"<br>  <dd>   Well, regardless what you do or say, it's all rhetorical. I know what I'd say...<br>   <dd>  "Carrots?" I asked.  "What kind of freakos are you?"<br>    <br>  "You know, the whole biodegradable thing...." he said while shrugging. The men behind him shifted uncomfortably, as though I had just pointed out that their heads were on backward, or maybe that the President had just farted. "Besides we feed them to the squirrels afterwards. They get tired of Snickers bars."<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images7/1.2.gif"><br>    <dd>  "Uh.....the rabbits?"<br> <dd>    "Different department," he said. "That's off the topic though.  You signed a contract many years ago to go out into the world and collect data for us, and the time has come for you to come back to the office and turn that data into information we can use for the Plan."<br>   <dd>   "Tell us what you know," they said, fingering their carrots.<br>   <dd>  A difficult task, especially when what you know mainly consists of what you learned on the back of children's sugar cereal boxes. Nevertheless, I would rather  have told them about the fat content of Cocoa Pebbles than undergo another session with those carrot billy clubs.<br>  <dd>   Funny, it was really dark in there, but I could see amazingly well.<br>    <dd>  I explained to them carefully that they must have had the wrong house, or at least the wrong tenant, because I certainly didn't remember signing any contracts and had no real interest in coming to work for them.<br>    <dd>  "I'm sure you'll enjoy being aware of working for us. We have our own health plan with dental coverage...."<br>    <dd>  (i'm never going to join a bunch of guys in white suits who pack fruit!)<br> <dd>    "...free classy uniforms with carrot holsters....."<br>   <dd>   "Please save me the self-flagellation," I retorted.<br>    <dd>  "...paid vacations..."<br>    <dd>  (oh no..he's starting to play hard ball.  no matter, i can handle it)<br>   <dd>  "...a company car..."<br>  <dd>    (must not give in. you can break my body but you can not break my mind...grrr)<br>  <dD>  "...and all the ice cream your stomach can hold...."<br>    <dd>  "You guys got a pen?  I think I left mine in my other pair of pants?"<br>   <dd>   Hey, everybody has their Achilles Heel, I like ice cream ...fuck you. I sang like a dreidel.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images7/1.3.gif"><br>   <dd>   Seems I was sent to infiltrate average life, report back and explain it to those who Just Don't Understand. The only problem is, where to start? Parliamentary procedure, survival of the fittest, sock drawers, religion, kosher food,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Robert's Rules of Order, astrology, drier lint, Bucket lint, lint in general. How am I supposed to explain lint? It just is. People believe in lint. They accept it. Status quo, quid pro quo, nice to see you again Clarice.<br>   <dD>   The revelation of my apparent previous career choice did explain a cacophony of idiosyncrasies I'd identified in myself, however. Ice cream being one of them. If I really had been a deep cover operative for those carrot wielding ice-cream thugs, they didn't blank my memory well enough. I could still remember being pulled out of the deepest cathode ray reverie by the sound of those ice cream trucks. Synaptic-motor response administered through the deep hypnotic broadcast of the truck's PA system and special ingredients in the Product ("Looks like we're gonna pump you full of hypnotics. Let me check.... Yep, you're in luck, we're only going to ruin your mind, not your body"). Homogenized,ultrapasteurized, artificially flavored, artificially coloured, fat free, fat added, now with NutraSweet, extra nipp-<p>   <dd>  <I>"-Hey what's this?"queried Corrie.<br></I>  <dd>   An abrupt memory had muscled its way to the surface, probably induced by their horrid fruit drugs.<br>  <dd>  <I> "A refrigerator. Modern man uses it to cool his food, thus inhibiting the growth of bacteria on said food, thus avoiding spoilage longer, thus allowing modern man to throw said food out because he is wasteful, not because said food is inedible," I responded.<br>   <dd>  "O....K....  Anyway, I can put my sandwich and Coke in it," he said over his shoulder as he walked toward the object of discussion.<br>   <dd>   "No." When I have a bad day I get very clipped with people.<br>   <dd>   "Why can't I put my stuff in your fridge?"he counter offered.<br>    <dd>  "Because there's no room, that's why." He was just as much of a fucking moron as my cat.<br>   <dd>  "What the hell you got in there then?"<br>   <dd>   "My ice cream. Don't touch it."<p></I>   <dd>  "Tell us what you know," he demanded. So I did.<br>  <dd>   I waxed poetic on the topics of cyanocobalmin and how BHT was added to packaging material to help preserve freshness; about virgin births and that cats can be both alive and dead if they're in a box. I tried.
