Funny, until now I hadn't heard anything about the killing of the bison. I watch and read the news sometimes, but I am by no means avid about it. After reading the article I pressed my friends and family for information: "Had they heard anything about this? Tell me what you know." The answer, which was not totally surprising was that; yes, they had heard about it, but no, they hadn't heard as much as I began to inform them of. There seemed to have been a few short blippits in amongst the much more interesting scandals of today's politicians.<br>    <dd>  So I thought I might use my position to help inform a public, who probably doesn't realize (or care), that there is something of importance to be informed about due to mismanaged media. On March 20, 1997, park officials confirmed that the Yellowstone herd, whose size was last estimated at around 3400 has had it's numbers thinned by the removal of over two thousand bison. Nearly two-thirds of the Yellowstone herd, the only free-roaming herd of wild bison in the world, are dead as a result of a harsh winter and an even harsher politically sanctioned slaughter.<br>   <dd>  This year Yellowstone faced the severest winter it has encountered since 1943. A combination of freezing rains and heavy snowfall had made foraging for grass nearly impossible for the sizable populations of Yellowstone Bison. Often they would have to burrow through four feet of snow to uncover an impenetrable layer of ice. The only feasible feeding grounds to be found were near the streams, rivers, and hot springs. One bull even took to eating the welcome mats from the visitor cabins to keep himself fed.<br><dd>     In the winter the park is closed down to normal vehicular travel, but the roads are kept well groomed for people who wish to go snowmobiling. Because of the high snow fall, these roads became ideal trails for the retreating herds of bison in search of foraging grounds. The bison took to the roads in record numbers, only to be stopped at both the northern and western borders.<br> <dd>    The cause of the ensuing execution is to be found in a disease called "brucellosis," which is known to cause premature abortions, low milk yields, and open sores on cattle. Brucellosis is carried by many different types of domestic and wild animals, including both the wild bison and elk of Yellowstone. Montana, the state bordering Yellowstone to the north and part of the west, currently enjoys a brucellosis-free status. Montana's Department of Livestock was given reason for concern when in 1985 the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) made threats against its status if any livestock were found in the state carrying the disease. From this point on, Montana's Department of Livestock demanded that Yellowstone be responsible for its herd of Bison, and assist in actions to relieve the possible threat they caused to Montana's livestock...even though the bison pose no identifiable threat since there have been no cases of cattle contracting brucellosis from bison in the wild.<br>  <dd>   On both fronts the bison were to be kept in trapping facilities and tested. Those who tested positive for the disease were to be shipped off to slaughterhouses, while those who tested negative were to be held or transported to quarantining facilities elsewhere. Unfortunately the heavy snows early in the winter season made the holding facilities at Gardener inoperable, and agents of the Department of Livestock, feeling they had no other recourse, began to shoot all the bison they could not catch crossing the borders. On the northern front, park workers were charged to hold all bison and ship them off to slaughterhouses, regardless of their disease status. In late February all bison who remained in the park were showing signs of severe starvation. By the end of this entire ordeal, over 1,070 bison were shot or killed in slaughterhouses, an estimated 900 starved to death, and about 700 others were unaccounted for, but their chances are grim.<br>  <dd>   Many attempts were made on almost all sides to find solutions to the problems, but it seems it was to no avail. Several Native American tribes requested that the bison testing negative for brucellosis be shipped to their reservations, to establish free-roaming tribal herds, but their requests went unanswered and the bison testing negative continued to be shipped to the slaughterhouses. A coalition of Wyoming ranchers and conservationists urged the Clinton Administration to drop the threat of eliminating Wyoming's brucellosis-free status on the premise that the transmission of brucellosis to cattle by wildlife poses an insignificant threat and the killing continued. Officials of APHIS even wrote to the governor of Montana stating that if the bison were kept on public lands outside the Yellowstone border, this would not threaten Montana's brucellosis-free status, and the governor replied that the only way to stop the shooting would be by direct order of the President. Yet the Secretary of the Interior responded that the federal government hasn't the power to compel the state of Montana to stop the shooting of bison. Each group involved seemed to assume that they could have done nothing to stop the situation, and none will take responsibility for the slaughter.<br>   <dd>  There are a few additional problems brewing up in Congress.In the U.S. Senate, Max Baucus, a democratic senator from Montana has said, "Perhaps the bison in the park should be managed a little more. [Yellowstone] is not a wilderness area." He is fully in support of Senate Bill S.745 that is calling for the round-up and testing of all bison within Yellowstone for the brucellosis disease. Any bison that tests positive for this disease would be destroyed. What the senator seems blissfully unaware of is that these bison are wild animals, the methods and technology used to control and transport cattle are totally ineffectual for bison. A sizeable proportion of the bison that were transported to slaughterhouses arrived dead or seriously injured. The very idea of testing all the Yellowstone bison and destroying those who carried the disease is even more inane when you consider the even larger population of brucellosis positive elk in Yellowstone, who might just as easily pass the disease back to the bison. At the same time Senator Conrad Burns had accused the Superintendent of Yellowstone, Mike Finley, of being a "dictator" rather than a superintendent, after Mr. Finley attempted to cease tending the snowmobile roads in the park to slow the bison from leaving the park so readily.<br>   <dd>  In the aftermath of this tragic incident a few minor notes should be made: The only bison that could have posed a threat to Montana's livestock were pregnant females who tested positive for brucellosis, and yet all bison were shot without distinction; bulls, calves, unpregnant females, and especially those bison who had tested negative for the disease. Auctions held to sell the bison parts grossed well over $102,566, and all of the proceeds went directly into the Montana Department of Livestock. An owner of one of the slaughterhouses reviewed lab results from two hundred of the bison slaughtered on his premises to find that only two of them had been actual carriers of brucellosis. This result was contested by the Montana State Veterinarian, but it can not be refuted that the wild elk population in the region have a higher percentage of carriers among them, and no action was taken against their species in order to protect the state's livestock. Finally a little additional information that shocked me when I read it, <B>livestock can be vaccinated against brucellosis!</B><br>  <dd>   By this time we are left with the memories of over two thousand dead bison, all the involved organizations pointing the blame at someone else, and a catastrophe that could have been prevented and never should have happened. It seems apparent to me that several of our representatives in Congress are completely out of touch with reality and may only make the situation worse. The American Bison had replenished its herds from a mere twenty-three surviving bison at the turn of the century and it is hard to tell whether they might be able to survive this continual narrowing of their gene pool.
