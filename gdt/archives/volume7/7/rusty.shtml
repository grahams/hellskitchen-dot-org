He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

Don't be disappointed. Think of it as if you were an East European: you're glad that you've got anything to chew on at all. If you're really lucky, you had to stand in line to get this issue of GDT.<p>   <dd>   FOR A BALKAN MISTRESS<br>    <dd>  Cabbage, beans and beer for lunch. Bulgaria-- I have the taste of you in my blood, the stink of your urine soaked trains in my clothes, and the fear of your industrial nightmares creeping through my mind.<br>   <dd>   Bulgaria-- Won't you come to my bed? Run your field scarred hands down my thin stretched skin, Press your violent lips against my rain-cold face. Hold your earth-brown eyes in my blood shot vision, and let me hear the throaty grunts of your passions.<br>   <dd>   Bulgaria-- Take me drunken on your darkened wine, down against your cold rivers, across your dusty mountains, through your forgotten blue monasteries, and arrive in my memories. My heart.<br>   <dd>   --March 9th, 1997<p> <center><hr width = 50%></center><p>   <dd>   PHOTO HISTORY<br>    <dd> So I was there When Mr. Washington Cleaner grabbed his first Leica.<br>     <dd> Yeah, it was in a little sweetshop just off Vitosha, a stumbling from the big domes of Alexander Nevsky.<br> <dd>     The machine merchant was all sweaty, he licking his lips and zooming the pile of Lira counted. I was cool, eating chocolate watching the deal go down. We knew it was a good one, cause everybody left the scene jumpy quick.<br>  <dd>    Then he was diggin' Sofia with me and in a smoky bus station dropped his sodi glass, and sez "Wancha take the first pitcha of me with my new camera."<br>  <dd>    --February 28th, 1997<p>    <center><hr width = 50%></center><p>  <dd>    GOTSE DELCHEV BUSES<br>   <dd>   Rhodopi morning, in dawn grey streets my breath a stiff cloud against black mountains and 6 AM blue sky dark. Crossing Gotse' park, our feet stamping frozen turf the city bus empty just a shower of tailpipe sparks in passing: now Gasoline smells like all the tired streets of Bulgaria.<br>    <dd>  Sultan moon is hiding dawn's edge- a scimitar sliver of silver riding the purpling edge of sky. Soldiers in great coats leaning by canvas bags filled with onions, old women rubbing fingers as ancient as Macedonian stones. My eyes among them on the station's edge I'm hollowed by cold light, and equalled by this old winter's venom.<br> <dd>     And in the little bus stop cafe a woman pounds out a dark black soup; the tan froth on it's edges reminds of cream from childhood's morning cow milk. And through the thick Balkan tobacco smoke I can see the sun rising.<br>   <dd>   Now my coffee's gone, and the big blue bus kicks it's coughing engine: time to go travellers lovers soldiers old mothers.<br>  <dd>    --March 7th, 1997<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
