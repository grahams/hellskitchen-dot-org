When it comes to politics...<br>  <dd>   a) You don't believe in formal political groups. You and your community just have a sense of "belonging together."<br> <dd>    b) You believe in just one way of engaging in external conflict: revenge cannibalism.<p>3. When you're sick you ask the doctor to...<br>   <dd>  a) extract foreign objects from your body that were placed there by hostile sorcerers.<br>   <dd>  b) chant, rub doctored leaves all over your body, and spit chewed ginger on your head.<p>Scoring:<br></td></tr></table> <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td width = 250 valign = top><dd>     &#149;If you had mostly a's, you are a Marind-anim at heart. You enjoy eating sago, coconuts, bananas, pork, taro, and yams. Your favorite stimulants most likely include kava, betel, and tobacco. You are probably Catholic, but you also may be Protestant. You often find yourself getting in arguments over garden land. Don't worry- just remind the other person about the threat of sorcery, and you'll resolve it in no time.<br></td><td valign = top width = 250>  <dd>   &#149;If you had mostly b's, you belong on Goodenough Island. You enjoy gardening and use magic in order to ensure a good yield. You have a 33% chance of divorce, usually on grounds of neglect, laziness, or infidelity. You are very distrustful of external authorities and prefer to use your own methods of social control, including public ridicule, ostracism, and revenge sorcery. But remember-- that external warfare could continue on indefinitely unless you take the first step and break the cycle of revenge cannibalism.<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/culture.html">Other Culture Kampfs in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/ma.html">Michele Amoruso</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
