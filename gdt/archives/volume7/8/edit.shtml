Because Hell's Kitchen can not afford it (our main financial support comes mainly from RIT. We use RIT money only to print on RIT. All other locations are paid for from other sources. That gets hard with no club or faculty support from U of R), we decided to try and implement a sort of "adopt-a-site" plan. An individual can voluntarily pay for 25 issues to be put wherever they wish. I chose MCC.<br> <dd>  So every Monday after getting out of work, I wander the hall's of MCC, feeling like a interloper, putting tiny stacks of issues in places that seem like good locations. Last Monday, however, when I returned to my vehicle, I found two presents. The first was a parking ticket. The second was the MCCop who wrote it, sitting in his car watching me.<br> <dd> The funniest thing is that the ticket will cost me $5.00, which is just under what I usually pay for the 25 issues on MCC. Maybe I'll just pay in issues.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
