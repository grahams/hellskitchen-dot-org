Other people and I occasionally remember that change has to come from within me (my own desire to change is the only truly powerful force in this area), not as something done to please Them&trade; (a gladiator with big muscles raring to go, but he's just on a sugar high bound to crash and burn under sustained assault). Currently, my life is in my own hands. I am not entangled with one who wishes to change me to fit their model of "what I should be," and I'm far enough away from my parents for them to have minimal interference power. I think I can be reasonably safe in my belief that I am attempting these changes for my own selfish reasons, which are the most valid reasons (did I mention that I have been reading Ayn Rand lately?). I have known for a long time that I am not happy, but I have never really known why or what I could do about it.<br>  <dd>   Through my reprogramming, I hope to become happier or at least to manage to be amused (by myself and others) a higher percentage of the time, I pray (to that supreme being: my psyche and motivation manufacturer) that I can find a way to make my motivation less bipolar. Since no one has ever been able to tell me where to purchase motivation, I have decided that the only practical supplier of motivation available to me is me. If I can generate it, internal motivation may prove to be one of my most valuable assets (right up there with my creativity and my insanity) in a couple months. I have decided that the highest potential for happiness for me lies along the route of self-employment (but without self motivation to pave that path, I'm sure I will end up flat on my face bleeding in many places). During school, when I have had motivational problems, I have just waited them out. I know, that with the combination of my high guilt content and low threshold for bad grades, I would manufacture some motivation at some point if I waited long enough. The main problem with this method is the side products of stress and depression that were also manufactured due to the length of fermentation occurring during the slow delivery of motivation. The motivation only arrived when I knew that if I did not start working right, I would not finish; finishing would require me to be a functioning, productive individual more than 70% of the hours each day working on my projects. I'm not sure what types of deadlines I will have to inspire motivation Out There&#153;, so I feel that I need to be on better terms with my supplier. Maybe if I make steady payments of amusement to my dealer, he will keep me hooked up with a constant fix of motivation.<br>   <dd>  I also have this vague suspicion that the quality of my life may go up with successful reprogramming. And if I am really blessed (once again talking about that same supreme being), passion (another commodity of which I have not been able to find a vendor) may actually be integrated into my existence.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/erasing.html">Other Erasing Eeyores in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/hd.html">Heather Danielson</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
