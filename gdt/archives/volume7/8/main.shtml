While looking through the instruction manual we found it so informative and helpful that we just had to share excerpts of it with our reading public...with the express written permission of Andvari (a subsidiary of Hell, Inc.), of course.<p></I><dd>    Dwarves are the most fascinating freaks of nature because of their complex social behavior. There are many varieties of dwarves, each with their own peculiar habits and colorations, and they are very interesting creatures to watch as they go about their activities. Your set provides an excellent way of keeping and observing the dwarves. They might make one part of the colony an eating area, make the cemetery in a different area, store relatives in a third area, etc.<br>   <dd>   Dwarves are fun to watch and care for. Your set will be a busy, bustling observatory. All you have to do is take care of your dwarves properly. This booklet will tell you how to feed and care for the dwarves. Read this booklet carefully and you will have much fun for a long time, reader-san.<br>  <dd>   What is a dwarf?  Dwarves belongs to the class of creatures known as Freaks of Nature. They are invertebrate animals, meaning they have no backbone, i.e., they swagger away from fights.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Dwarves have permanently bent legs, or are "bow-legged," from hiding too many hedgehogs. Even their minds are bandy, and they often suffer from alien hand disorder,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#167;</A></a> providing hours of amusement. The dwarf has a head and a two sectioned body; only close inspection with a magnifying glass can verify this, however, because when you're that short, it really doesn't matter.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a><br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images8/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    There are over one million different freaks of nature known to science and P.T. Barnum, and many more are not discovered yet. In fact, there might be 6,000 different species of dwarves alone. Dwarves belong to the pariah class known as Libidule,  which translates as "little freak" or "military power."  With dwarves, only the males and young females have vestigial tails. This class, Libidule, is the most advanced of the frightening humans, living in communities, such as dwarf colonies, rather than alone. They are often heavily armed militants, taking their giant neighbors hostage and demanding the creation of dwarf homelands.<br><dd>    <U>Metamorphosis of the dwarf</U>-- Metamorphosis, meaning literally, "before a body of water," refers to the different stages of development of the adult dwarf from the egg. Dwarf eggs are laid by the queen dwarf in geometric clusters looking like bowling pins, and are quickly moved to nursery rooms in the colony's west wing, where nursemaid worker dwarves look after them. The eggs are laid in the spring and summer and within a period of a few weeks they hatch into creatures looking remarkably like Tonka trucks. These small, durable, yellow, truck-like creatures are totally dependent upon children, requiring them for their movement. They (the dwarfs...not the children) are always hungry and the worker dwarves are kept busy for weeks feeding the larvae by the cover of darkness. Then the larvae suddenly stop eating and are ready for the next stage: the pupal stage.<br>   <dd>   Using their insidious mind control, the dwarf pupae force children to cover them in a mud chrysalis. It is at this time that the various parts of the adult dwarf begin to take shape. After a gestation that can vary from several hours to several years, the pupa begins to move her tiny, tiny legs and tail. The dwarves in the nest gather around and will help the birth by tearing away the pupal mud if necessary. The young dwarf emerges, releasing a cloud of noxious fumes, and stands on wobbly legs. Because it takes a few days for their chitinous (meaning "novelty condom shaped") bodies to harden, newly hatched dwarfs are easy prey. The sulfurous clouds released at birth are a natural defense, used to keep Predators and circus recruiters away from the young dwarf, and allows it to skitter under a rock or eat its own leg, depending on how bad the smell is. If she survives this perilous time, the young adult is ready to begin a lifetime of work. She needs no learning period-- she quickly follows her instinct and starts performing her complicated tasks.<br><dd>   <U>The Queen</U> -The Queen is the most important dwarf in the colony. She is the mother of all the others. In active colonies, wench dwarves wash the queen, feed her the best Mandarin Oranges, polish the silver,  and take care of her fresh ovulations. The queen is much larger than the worker dwarves and she spends most of her life getting laid.<br>    <dd>  Each Queen begins life as a young, tailed, female; that is to say, "Baby's got Back." She does not help build the nest or worry about gathering food. Instead, she sits around and watches "All Ricki All The Time."  The menial labor is done entirely by the worker dwarves, all number&fnof; than a hake. In every colony there are a few tailed males, or breeders, who do not work either. On a special day, in spring or summer, the tailed dwarves take to the bars in swarms. The males mate with the females in the corner pockets of the pool tables. The males die quickly, usually lodged between barstools and wrapped around overhead fans, but for each fertile female a new life is beginning. She drops to the floor and seeks shelter from the onslaught and seals herself off underground, making herself a prisoner. After her breathing eventually slows, she settles down and rubs off her vestigial tail.<br>  <dd>    She will never wag again. She has become a true queen.<br>     <dd> Though she may live for 105 years, she will never go above ground again. Instead, she ovulates like mad and starts her own colony. A few of her eggs will turn into tailed males, and a smaller number into tailed females, but the largest number will be of tailess females or workers. This is the form we see most often in local circuses.<br><dd>  <U> Harvester Dwarves</U> - These are the dwarves that come with your set, known by the name of Agricule. They are one of the most interesting and best known dwarf species in the US. These dwarves are grain harvesters in the Bible Belt, and they move along tiny highways in the grain fields. These highways meet at the entrance to Methodist Churches. Worker dwarves collect grains and grass seeds and carry them along the highways to the mouth of the church/bomb shelter, where they then scurry religiously underground to store their food for the impending apocalypse. "Chewers" masticate the seeds until it becomes a sticky, dough-like material. This Dwarf Bread<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a> is placed in bins for use later on as the Holy Host. Because there are usually patches of grass around the church entrances of the harvester dwarves, it was thought that the dwarves planted their own seeds to have a convenient source of food. This is incorrect, however. They are too stupid; it is more likely that the grass seeds were dropped around the entrance by dwarves scurrying to salvation.<br>    <dd>  To have the healthiest dwarf ranch it would be best to find your own dwarves in your backyard or garden. These dwarves will be use-ta your local climate and conditions, and will thrive in your set. Also, there is the possibility of collecting your own queen dwarf. We are not permitted to send queen dwarves across state lines, so the only way to obtain one is to find one yourself. One important fact to remember is not to mix dwarves from different colonies. They will fight to eliminate each other. The dwarves we will ship to you will be from the same colony so, you will not have any problems.<br>   <dd>   Whether you collect your own dwarves or send away to us for a supply of dwarves, the instructions for getting them into your module are basically the same. Instructions for catching your own dwarves:<p></td></tr></table><TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><font size = +1><center><B>A Dwarf Catcher is part of the Dwarf Resort set.<br> Please treat her nicely.</B></font size></center><br>1. Bait the bottom of the Dwarf Catcher with a pinch of vinegar.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a> Cider vinegar is best. Ferment the vinegar with a drop or two of saliva so that it is semi-alcoholic. Also place a very small piece of raw or cooked hamburger meat into the catcher's hand. Dog meat can be used if hamburger is inaccessible.<p> 2. Locate an active dwarf colony by turning over flat rocks, old pieces of wood, or suspiciously small shanty towns. Dwarves use these to shelter themselves from rain and sunlight.&part;(front page) Vacant lots, fields, or gardens are likely places where a colony might be located. Prop up the rock or wood by placing a small stone under it. Lay the Dwarf Catcher on her side next to the area where dwarves have been seen. Check at intervals to see if the Dwarf Catcher has caught any dwarfs. If possible, leave them overnight. Dwarf scouts are always looking for food sources for the colony. When a single dwarf finds the food it likes, it signals other members by pissing in the bushes and screaming obscenities, thus directing them to the food source. They will attack the Dwarf Catcher in large numbers, but this will pose no significant threat to the Catcher, as most dwarves are laughingly ineffective in combat situations.<br><p><center><table border width=240><tr><td valign = top align = center><B>WARNING: Never touch dwarves as some can bite and pinch.</B><br> </td></tr></table></center> The Dwarf Catcher may be placed wherever dwarves are observed moving about in vast herds. Dwarves may be more inclined to attack the dwarf catcher in black light.<p>3. If you cannot find dwarves in your area, you are shit out of luck. But, you may use the enclosed coupon for obtaining a supply of Harvest/Worker dwarves directly from us. Please fill out the coupon carefully in ink. Shipment will be made within four to six weeks. Dwarves are difficult to ship in the months of December, January, and February, so if there is a delay, be assured the postal workers are cleaning up the mess. In cases of extreme cold weather, they will die, but we will ship them anyway. Though some dwarves may die during shipment, don't worry about it;  by instinct, the other dwarves will actually remove them to a separate section which they will use as a burial ground. This is perfectly natural and there should be enough dwarves to stock your Dwarf Resort. It is best not to have too many dwarves. The fewer the dwarves, the harder their struggle.<p> <center><table border width=240><tr><td valign = top align = center><B>NOTE:  It is against federal law to ship queen dwarves. The dwarves shipped to you with the enclosed certificate will be worker dwarves, who will be quite interesting to observe. If you gather your own dwarves, you may be able to find a queen.  Dwarves can only be shipped in the continental United States. Sorry, Guam.</B><br> </td></tr></table></center></multicol> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> It's hard to run when you're packin' a hedgehog up your ass.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#167;</A>  Alien-hand syndrome results from severe brain trauma, either planned or unintentional, that allows one's hand to act independently of one's will, sometimes in a violent, destructive manner.
