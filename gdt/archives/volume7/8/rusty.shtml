He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

Seemed to be time to make some photos of the crazy scene in the Bulgarian bars, as the thought had come that I would deeply miss the free expression that was to be found in the sweaty little places all the kids hung out in. First in Our Bar, I sidled in to have the regular (Zagorka beer and a "sandvich salam") and just as I began watching the crowd (10 people in a room the size of an average American kitchen), three Bulgarian boys started talkin' to me, and we were soon jiving about rock music and Jack Kerouac. Old Jack's made a big splash in the new youth here, and I often wonder how good the translation is for his books. How could the poetry and mania of  "On the Road" possibly be translated?  Maybe this means that I should learn French so I can really understand Camus and Baudelaire. I whipped off to my room and returned with a biography full of pictures from Lowell to San Francisco, and they all were digging it, began many rounds of bottle-raised cheers.<br>    <dd>  One of these fellas seemed a shocking carbon copy of a friend from Rochester: Danny Shankin. And though their gesture and poise weren't the same, I kept staring at the same smile. This boy could have been his brother. All of them being from Sophia, they explain that they've come down to see a friend. "We like Blagoevgrad very much. More cheaper than Sofia, and everything very close for walking," says the Danny clone. They've been drinking for hours, they say, and have the slurred voices to prove it. Slamming down our beer bottles, it's suddenly decided that we're heading for the Drum, the smoky, crazed little sweatbox of a bar that's underneath Volga. Before leaving, they insist that I come to a big party they're having in a village north of Sophia next week. Not sure that I can make it, I promise to try to attend. One of them hurriedly writes an address on a twenty Leva note (which would buy a coffee this summer, and is chump change now).<br>     <dd> It's about 1 AM when we get to Drum, and the place is going crazy. Buying a beer at the counter, I run into Nadia, who gives me a kiss and tells me that she's just aced all her exams at U.Z. (the Bulgarian Univ. here in town). Spinning a couple of small dances with her, I notice that she's got a boy waiting for her, watching me. "Is he your boyfriend?", I ask with some amusement. "No, he likes me very much, and I don't like him so much."  Ah, you're in for a rough ride, buster Bulgarian boy slouchin' over yer beer; this one's as free and crazy as they make 'em...<br>   <dd>   I'm snapping a few shots and thinkin' to myself that there's nothing like this in white America, and never will be. All the tight-shirted, respectable Americans could never possibly get so excited about anything to do more than shiver their hips. But these kids are swinging to everything: Joe Cocker and the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner wailing along "Proud Mary," and everybody with a girl swingin' and shaking like it was New Year's eve 2000. One chick grabs the rafters (which are only 7 1/2 feet up) and swings upside down in the midst of her troop of friends. Nadia's bumping my hips with her ecstatic shaking while I try to focus my lens. The air is so hot I'm stripped down to a tee shirt and still feel ready to sweat (while outside it's almost snowing). There's not a single heater in Drum; it's only the quaking bodies and cigarettes that make it so thick.<br>    <dd>  In the midst of it all, a little Balkan gem comes over with a friend, and shouting in my ear, asks me if I would take a picture of her friend with boyfriend. Sure, sure, why not?  And I snap a snapshot then ask the introducer's name. Magdalena. She's a long drink in the desert, a short, spunky lady with beautiful black Bulgarian hair, deep brown eyes that jump into a smile, and curvalacious delicious hips to swing with. And still a little interested in photos, I've got my camera slung backwards, bumping on my shoulder, dancing fun swings with Maggi (she says "Mahgee").  Hey, little girl, What's your name!  You sho lookin' good tonight. What a great flying time life is, if you can just dance crazy and hang it all out into the night and go!<br>  <dd>    Now it's gettin' late, and I need to be up early, say adieu to Maggi, and drift home to bed. "You will be here tomorrow night?" she asks, all glancing shy. Damn straight, honey, I'll be here. At last, a beautiful girl to wave away my Silvia - Gueri beat luck, down trodden romantic musings. Hah, tomorrow be Thursday, I'll just take her to Graffiti, too.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
