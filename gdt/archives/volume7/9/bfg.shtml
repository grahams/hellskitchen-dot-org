He is what is more commonly referred to as a gestalt entity: not one, but many individuals. The real people who took part in theses great deeds were in fact a group of poor, unfortunate sufferers of a strange syndrome known as "Tourrettes Syndrome."<br>   <dd>   Many victims of this disorder often exhibit symptoms by physical twitches or shouting out long, obscure chains of obscenities. However, a rather less well publicized population of Tourrettes patients have a peculiar variation on the syndrome, often referred to in medical journals as <I>senex ast bono</I>. Rather than the quite distracting twitches of some victims or the offending heckles of others, those suffering from <I>senex ast bono</I> are noted for their loud, jubilant outcries of, "Hah!", "Good God!", and "I feel good!" They are also known for such antic behavior as producing loud popping noises which are often followed by such exuberant phrases as "ba-dum-bum-bum" or "oh-lolly-lolly-lolly."<br>  <dD>   Strangely enough, the effects of close proximity of such misbegotten souls with the general public is quite opposite that of their Tourrettes Syndrome brethren. The people who most often work, live, and interact with such afflicted individuals often find themselves experiencing unexplainable sensations of well-being and happiness.<br>   <dd>  It is interesting to note that these <I>senex ast bono</I> members of society seemed to have been one of the largest catalysts in influencing the lyrics of many song writers from the early fifties up until the mid-seventies. With, of course, the possible exception of the song "The Age of Aquarius."<br>	<dd>		-the Bare-foot Girl<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
