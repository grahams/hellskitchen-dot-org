Arbor Day, Earth Day, Mother's Day, even college activities such as the U of R's Dandelion Day or RIT's Noname Festival. They are all celebrating the end of winter or stress agricultural fertility and are simply the fragments of Beltaine, or May Day, splintered over the years.<br>  <dD>   Not too long ago, our forefathers would celebrate May Day as a way of welcoming the fertile months back. Traditionally involving singing and dancing, the festivities usually centered around a pole erected in the center of a town. Normally made of white birch, the tree was cut down, paraded through the town by the May Queen and her revelers, and then erected with great pomp and ceremony. Depending on the area of Europe, the Maypole would either be wrapped in ribbon by dancers, or adorned with wreaths and other decorations. It is from these traditions that the modern practice of decorating Christmas Trees comes.<br> <dd>    For the pagans of Europe, the May Queen became the personification of the Earth Mother, often proceeding the pole naked or clothed in a simple white dress and wearing bells to ward off mischievous faeries. The pole...well, in this case it is not a cigar.<br>   <dd>  Today, though Maypoles are little more than a novelty in the United States, they are regularly put up in the British Isles, Germany, and other areas of Europe, serving as the center a town pride and acting as a display of what crafts the towns produce.<br>    <dd>  On the first of May this year, GDT and <I>Melancholy Predator</I> erected a Maypole on the RIT campus, complete with presiding May Queen. We hope that in the years to come, RIT will recognize the potential importance of a Maypole. With a different colour ribbon for each College, it could be a place where all Colleges and students can show what it is they do best. Give the students a place where pride and ability can be shown, rather than just a release and excuse to drink. <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
