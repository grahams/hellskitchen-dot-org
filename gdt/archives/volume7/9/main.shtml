This is because it is the concept we are most familiar with. But in the trendy new spirit of multiculturalism (brought to you by Big Blue), we think it is high time we had a shot at another major world religion. With that, we bring you...<p><font size = +1><center><B>GDT's Look at the Origin of Islam</B></center></font size><p><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images9/1.1.gif"><br><dd><I>Our story begins in 7th century Arabia. Muhammad walks out of the desert and approaches a small group of soon-to-be followers.</I><p><dd><B>Muhammad:</B> Hey! I've just been talking with God!<br><dd><B>Skeptic 1:</B> Oh really. And what did God say?<br><dd><B>Muhammad: </B>We are the righteous! We have been given his final, perfect plan for living ethically and morally, and it is our responsibility to follow it!<br><dd><B>Muslim 1 <I>(formally Skeptic #1)</I>: </B>Wow. <I>(significant pause)</I> What should we do with this knowledge?<p><center><I>Silence.</I></center><p><dd><B>Muslim 2: </B>I know! We could build an honest, law abiding society that preserves and expands the knowledge of the ancients. We can build a society that will pull Western Europe out of the Dark Ages so in future eras they can take credit for everything.<p><center><I>General muttering of agreement.</I></center><p><dd><B>Dissenting Voice:</B> Yeah, but will the chicks dig it?<br><dd><B>Muslim 1:</B> Okay, so what else should we do?<p><center><I>Silence.

No one notices.</I></center><p><dd><B>One to Another:</B> It was under our noses the whole time.<br><dd><B>Muslim 1:</B> But how will we tell who's who? I don't know about you guys, but all us heathens look pretty much the same to me.<br><dd><B>All:</B> Hmmmm....<br><dd><B>Bobby:</B> Um, we could, uh, wear towels on our heads?<br><dd><B>Muslim 2:</B> Bobby, not only are you stupid but-<br><dd><B>Muslim 3: </B>No, wait! That's a great idea!<p> <center><I>All mumble reluctant acceptance. Bobby runs from an approaching clown.</I></center><p><dd><B>Blow-me-self-up Dib-ar:</B> But isn't there something we could do about commerce?<p> <center><I>Everyone looks blank.</I></center><p> <dd><B>Dib-ar: </B>Ah, like, open some small markets on the corners of trade routes and sell cheap iced drinks?<p> <center><I>Still silence</I></center><p><dd><B>Dib-ar, <I>looking nervous</I>: </B>We could call them 9-11s? Or not....<p><center><I>Muhammad finishes his twitchy dance and slowly gets to his feet.

And those who choose not to see the holy way,  shall be smitten by the hand of God. <I>(a.k.a. A sucking chest wound caused by an AK-47)</I>.<br> <dd><B>All:</B> YEAH!<p><center><I>Muhammad has fallen asleep and slumps to the ground.
