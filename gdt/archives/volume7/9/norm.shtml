We swear we're not making this up) is one of the coolest offshoots of the various men's groups that promote grown adults to go into their backyards, beat on drums, howl at the moon, and cry about being circumcised. If you lie awake at night with tears slowly coursing down your stubbled cheeks because your circumcised penis feels lonely and exposed in a cold, uncaring world, then the NORM is definitely for you.<br><table width = 250><tr><td width = 250 valign = top><center><IMG width = 250  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images9/norm2.gif"><br><B>Pasty-white-guy equipped with PUD (Penis Uncircumcising Device).</center></B></td></tr></table><br> <dd>    Meetings for the University of Rochester's branch of the NORM take place Wednesdays in the basement of Wilson Commons, room 104. Beginning at 8pm, meetings usually last less than half-an-hour, at which time the captive members contemplate how best to dismember Dixie (their cult leader/editor-in-chief) in five strokes or less (got to keep under par), sometimes mention writing material for issues that then promptly gets ignored, and plot how to expand their horizons...or at least the penal epidermis of diminished men on the campus.<br><dd>   One the best known members of the NORM, Dr. Jim Bigelow, is the author of<I> The Joy of Uncircumcising</I>, put out by Hourglass Book Publishing (PO Box 171, Aptos CA 95001, ISBN 0-9630482-1-X). In the tome Dr. Bigelow, a former Christian minister, advances the opinion that the circumcision of children is a physical assault on par with other activities like kindergarten, wearing a leash, and being forced to orally gratify you. Yeah, YOU!<br><dd>   Fear not, however, there is help. The good Reverend outlines several methods that circumcised men can regain the attractive hood to cover their glans, thus keeping it moist, protected, and providing a breeding ground for yeast that you can later share with your sexual partner...or make bread with. By using a 115$ Penis Uncircumcising Device, or PUD (again, I swear I'm not making this up), the available free skin of the penis is stretched over the glans. Once the penis looks like a sea anemone on display at the Camden Aquarium in New Jersey, an "O-ring" is attached. Weighing anywhere between 10 to 22 ounces, depending on just how much of a man you really are, the weight gently yanks that fucker down toward your knee caps.<br>   <dd>  To help you speed the process along, and keep your penis from oscillating like a pendulum on a spastic Grandfather Clock, there are a series of elastic-like cords that can be used to connect a knee brace to the PUD. Making a kind of penis-apult, the wearer is assured of constant pressure on their PUD, though the risks are always high.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a><br><dd>   Taking as long as 5 years the procedure is FUN (Fucking Un-Necessary). Regardless, the U of R's branch of the NORM has been hard at work for over 10 years, instilling a sense of impotence (publishing only 3 times a year) and that of missing something of importance. You can't convince us that they aren't bent on making men think their penis is missing some crucial bits here and there. If their logo isn't a smile with a sperm, we can't imagine what it is; that's the happiest half set of chromosomes we've ever seen.<br>  <dd>   If you would like be be placed on a mailing list along with other NORM members, send the following message to majordomo@lists.foreskin.com:<br><center>SUBSCRIBE restoration</center><br>  <dd>   Send mail to the group by writing to:<br> <center>restoration@foreskin.com</center><table width = 250><tr><td width = 250 valign = top><center><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol7/images9/norm3.gif"><br><B>Sea anemone on display at the Camden Aquarium in New Jersey, equipped with "O-ring."</center></B></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A> One of the more graphic PUD incidents occurred to Mr. DeSeabra, head of the NORM's New York Chapter. While running to catch a subway, his safety was off and he accidentally fired, sending his PUD rocketing out of his pants. It managed to strike the cart of "Steve The Hot Dog Man," upsetting it and sending wieners spinning out of control. Amid shouts of, "What the hell was that?" and "DOWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT!" several Vegans were forced to ingest the airborne processed-meat shrapnel. There were no other casualties.<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br> 	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/jf.html">Josh French</A> <br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
