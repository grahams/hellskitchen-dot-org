He now studies at the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG), teaches English, broadcasts an Alternative music radio show, takes the occasional weekend adventure, and hangs out with the wrong crowd as much as possible.

After our photo class, I spoke for a while with Florian, an Albanian boy all tall and dark, with a George Michael beard.  He'd just returned from Tirana, and though he didn't want to talk much about it, he said he could never go back to Albania.  His mother gave him the last of the family money and told him to get out of the country fast.  Sneaking through rebel and gov't check points filled with crazy Kalishnakov carrying men, he finally had to pay a farmer to smuggle him in a truck full of cattle crossing to Macedonia on a small mountain road at night.  Now he was back in Blagoevgrad. Strong, but a little bewildered.  We had a mutual interest, as I had told Kael I would find her some grass and he had the connections.  No problem, man.  He takes a ten spot from me and promises to bring me a bag in Graffiti.<br>   <dd>   Finally time comes free and there is some space for a little cat nap.  Because after all my dancing and late drinking, need was still to rise at a nasty early hour of 8, and I was tired, tired, tired.  Down in my slow, under-water dreams, I dreamed of Maggi, her curved lips breaking smiles and driving my poor old human body all crazy with the want of her.  Rising for a small bite at Our Bar, I then showered my body all squeaky clean and grinned at my new-stubbled head in the mirror.  Patchouli tonight, lots of patchouli, and she'll smell me and love my exotic pheromone.  Slip on my soft and comfy corduroy tan- brown slacks, a white tee-shirt and multi-designed brown dress shirt.  I'm smart in the mirror, and now it's time to go down to Drum, as she said to come at eleven.  But I play it cool and go back to Our Bar, drink a Zagorka with Nevena; got to be a little late so she don't know I'm all eager and jumpy with the zip of girl-wanting-fun in my veins.  I've just received my father's beautiful documentary movies and want to show them at school; Nevena promises to help out and get the Movie Club VCR for a little show.<br>  <dd>    Drum is packed again, and looking across the place, I spot Maggi watching me.  She smiles and waves me over to lean on the big beat up old pine bar with her friend Elena.  A tallish blond girl, she had a great laugh, but a spooky evil look in her eye.<br>   <dd>    Before I can order a beer, the girls decide they want to drink tequila.  We all dab salt on our hands, squeeze lemon concentrate into the tequila, then lick the salt and slam the big shots.  Bulgarian tequila tastes a lot more like sweet rum than tequila, and I wonder if it's all artificial or if they at least try to make it from some cactus. Anyhow, the girls don't know the difference and think their Bulgarian tequila is great, and I won't argue because they're so happy about it.<br>    <dd>  Maggi and I dance a few nice spins then lean on the bar.  Turning to me with a wild smile, Elena tells me that she's a BSP (socialist party) member and sure that all of Bulgaria's problems come from the SDS (democrats).  I just shrug and tell her that I hate politics.  In a moment Maggi turns to me and says "Do you know about Macedonia? You know it's ours?  Macedonia is part of Bulgaria!"  Oh man, don't lay this bad-dream nationalist hyper-bullshit on me. You were doing so well before, girl.  A bit startled, I say, "Yes, and I guess Europe is part of Asia."  She doesn't know quite what to make of this, and tells me to dance with her instead.  OK, darlin'. Lets just be lovey and leave politics for the vultures and maggot hounds of the tired, starving blue streets of humanity's soul-eater machines.<br>  <dd>    The brassy, jumpy Serb-Turk-Bulgarian songs of Underground come on, and Maggi does the wild Bulgarian gypsy dance.  I'm trying to follow but she bursts into laughter.<br>   <dd>    "No, like this, Krees, move your stomach, no your heeps!"  She demonstrates, standing away from me with raised arms, finger snapping with small shuffly steps she weaves with her arms while gyrating her pelvis so that her belly wiggles and her hips stay still.<br>      <dd> Wow, I didn't know I had muscles that would do that!  No, it's no use, I keep bringing my Latin hip-swing moves to it anyway.  She just smiles and continues, a gorgeous Balkan belly dancer flirting with her dark eyes and curvy smile.  I can't help myself, and sidle up to lay a kiss on those shiny soft lips. She just kisses me back with that same drive-me-crazy smile.  Between our flirty gaze Elena cuts in and hollers "OK, OK, haide za Grafitti!"<br>    <dd>  We wander out into the crisp cold and hunching in our jackets, make a quick run to the "discoteka."  It's warm inside, the big thumping, grinding sound of modern techno pounding.  I try to smuggle the girls in behind my AUBG card (we get in free on Thursdays), but we're nudged by the bouncer and the girls have to shell out 200 leva. (Which is still less than 20 cents).  The girls take position beside one of the big speaker stacks and we're frolicking to Prodigy mean- cuts right away.  I've gotta find Florian, so I tell 'em I'll be back soon, and sift through the heavy, packed crowds.<br>   <dd>   Beside the biggest of the 3 bars he's hanging with his gang all slap-hand happy, girlfriend leaning against him to tell him sweet things. "So you wanna try it first?", he shouts into my ear.  OK, so we're standing there beside/behind the corner of the bar and he whips out a Brady-Bunch straight pipe and lights up.  Freak out!  I'm giggling myself funny by the time the pipe passes from a couple of his buddies to me.  I'm getting a big drag and one of the guys tears off his shirt to exhibit his big Bulgarian Lion tattoo.  So I've gotta show my tats too, and here we are in a cloud of sweet, green pot smoke, half naked in a dance club.  Aww, ain't nobody noticing us here in the corner, Huck.  I keep wondering how I'll ever adapt to tight-ass America again, while the girls around us are giving big cheers and shouting for us to continue the strip tease.  Oh, it's good weed, and Florian reaches into his pack then hands me a bag that would cost me $150 in the USA.  Holy shit, what am I going to do with it!  I can smell its sweet young perfume from arm's distance, and once I roll it up smallish, it's a huge bulge that takes up my entire deep pants pocket.   Pulling on my shirt I keep grinning and wander back across the club.<br>    <dD>  In front of the speakers, the girls are dancing all slow and boredly; Where's our boy?  So I grab Maggi and we swing into Depeche Mode, while Elena smiles, leaning against a column.  It's a long night of dancing that goes on, until we're both sweating and grinding against each other on the dance floor then leaning in the corner for big, passionate kisses.  Dance has turned into the ecstatic ritual of sex that it's meant to be, and we, veins filled with screaming desires, almost forget that we're in crowded club.  Now and again I catch wild stares from my friends from AUBG, and one long, sad, baleful glance from a girl who's had a crush on me for too long.  Nevermind, it's just fine with me if they wanna stare...<br>    <dd>  By 4am we're all exhausted and head out.  I'm cursing that there's no way to take her home since my roommate is there, asleep.  But the cold night air is like a cold shower, and she takes my hand and guides me on a long walk home to her house.  A long good night kiss and the promise to meet me again on Saturday.  Then I'm walking home with mind spinning and wanting for her so badly, loving the sweet tantalization that life plays us.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/rusty.html"> Other Rusty Curtain Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume7/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
