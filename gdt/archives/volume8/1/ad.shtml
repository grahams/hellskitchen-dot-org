So, we challenge you, our readers, to come up with topics for us to write about.<br>   <dd>  As an incentive, we're offering ahhhh...something, but we're not telling or worried; even if there are issues we can't write about, people are so apathetic we won't hear anything..<br>   <dd>  You've only got a few weeks (10 of'um) before the end of the quarter, so get cracking. Here's the rules:<p><UL><LI>&#149; We require at least two weeks to write and publish the idea.<LI>&#149; All ideas must be printed before the last issue.<li>&#149; Not all ideas will be first page material. Some may show up as Dear BFG's, God Files, From the Corner, After Dinner Mints, or any other column we regularly run.</UL><p>Send your ideas to GDT@iname.com<br></B></font color></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/ads.html">Other Ads in this Volume</A><br> <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> - <A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
