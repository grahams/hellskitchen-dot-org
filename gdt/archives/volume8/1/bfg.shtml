Far be it from me to answer with an entirely straight forward answer...but it's far from me.<br>   <dd>   Why did I choose this name to go by? I didn't. My colleague did, and before him about a quarter of the RIT campus. Even if that short snippet in the Distorter&#153; a few  years ago dubbed me, "that barefoot chick," it's close enough to the other. It is more accurately a professional reason. However unlikely the probability, I know there are still some people unable to put two and two together and realize who writes this column even if my name is attached to the top of it. It's really just a great way of cutting down on unwanted, idiotic mail messages to my e-mail account.<br>   <dd>  The definition of a 'barefooter' seems to be awkward at best. If it were strictly assumed that a barefooter were a person who merely walks about barefoot, that would be one thing; for starters it would be correct. However, it seems that the barefoot definition is some hodge-podge mix of vegetarians and escapees from the film Deliverance. Several of my friends now are people who used to be under the impression that I must be some huge hippy-eyed flake who spends her days waggling her head, saying "Wow," and upon occasion watching the pretty lights go by. I find these people and their assumptions much more comforting than that other large segment of my local community who seems to think I'm some really interesting person and wouldn't it be great to get to know me. This second group scares me, as they often strike while I sit in the middle of a dinning hall and the person sitting next to me just introduced themselves and seems intent on telling me about the conditioner they use on their hair. Or they approach me and start off some scintillating conversation with, "so you're barefoot" or, "you strike me as an interesting person." How do you answer something like that? "Yes?" or "Uhuh, well I'm just going to go correlate things in the stern."<br>   <dd>   So in the end I can only say that I have eaten meat, I'm not inclined to hug every tree I see, I have a pretty good concept of how electricity works, and I've only made one boy squeal like a pig. The definition of a barefooter is sort of like stone soup and as soon as people will act sensibly and take all those blasted vegetables out of it, I'll admit to fitting that definition. Until then the Magic Eight Ball says, "Not Today."<br>	<dd>	-the Bare-foot Girl<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
