The real competitors in the Apple survival war aren't Apple vs. Microsoft, it's Apple's Greed vs. Apple's Genius. Microsoft just gets the blame because it took advantage of Apple's civil war and stole the GUI market away from them. If you are saddened, it ought to be because this deal does nothing but prolong the sad state of affairs at Apple, once again avoiding any sort of actual possibility for a long-term remedy that works.<br>    <dd>   The Alliance is nothing more than a quick, elegant fix for some of Apple's problems...and quick fixes seldom lead anywhere. Experts agree: the only true solution to Apple's situation is to completely separate its hardware and software operations and open up MacOS licensing once and for all. What troubles me the most about the Alliance is that it puts Apple in a safety zone where the possibility of splitting doesn't have to be considered for survival, now that the world's largest maker of software has given Apple its stamp of approval. Apple's recent decision to end licensing of the MacOS is no doubt related to its recent injection of stability by Microsoft.<br>    <dD>   If anything else, this deal spices up the outlook on the future of computing for some time to come. This Alliance has tremendous potential to change the world of computing as we know it. The Apple-Microsoft Alliance has control over almost every desktop computer worldwide and Apple has patents on all sorts of neat little software doodads that Microsoft would love to get its hands on.<br>   <dd>   But let's get one thing straight: The main reason Microsoft agreed to this transaction was because it feared the imminent collapse of Apple. Do you think Microsoft spent $150 million on non-voting Apple stock because it felt bad for Apple?  If Apple were to go under, Microsoft would hold a monopoly on the personal computer operating system software market, making it a prime target for anti-trust regulation. Instead, Microsoft is perfectly thrilled to allow Apple a small piece of the pie, so long as it keeps the DOJ happy.  However, that special slice is continuing to shrink, and Microsoft is worried. By lending Apple a hand, it helps to stabilize the MacOS platform and ensure the status quo continues at Apple and Microsoft.<br>     <dD>  In the end, this alliance means nothing to Apple except for a few more years of vegetative existence. Any new innovations Apple creates for its MacOS platform can now be legally copied by Microsoft due to the patent-sharing portion of the agreement.  In other words, future computing innovations for the MacOS can go right down the toilet when it comes to using them as a selling point, since Microsoft operating systems can now legally develop identical features.<br>     <dd> Apple can't win in this setup. Microsoft can sell its stake in Apple after three years and in the interim if Apple rebounds as sales and market share begin to pick up, Microsoft will be frightened by this and drop Apple cold, leaving it to once again fend for itself in the computer marketplace. If Apple continues to become more troubled and eventually collapses, oh well. Ultimately, Apple is now dependent on Microsoft's charity.  Either way, if there was any question that Apple might rise to power once again, this deal certainly seals Apple's fate.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
