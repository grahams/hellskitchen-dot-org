I got drafted into writing this editorial, so I'm going to make this quick and above all, around the point.<br>  <dd>   For those of you out there fortunate enough to have never laid eyes on this publication, through shear willpower or accident, GDT is a "sardonic publication" as my sidekick likes to say. We are actually a satire publication. We utilize satire, sarcasm, irony, lunacy, pop culture references, personal jokes and occasionally even the God's Own Truth&trade; to get our pointed notions across. Think of us as an exercise of futility. It is futile to think anyone will understand every little reference we make and it is futile to think that most of our readers even try, much less care. The absolute measure of our futility is that we like to ignore all this and go about our lives just the same. For whatever reasons of their own, our writers do try to hold a mirror up to the world and show just how ludicrously our insignificant planet has turned out after millennia of secret organizations. So now you know in a nutshell what GDT is. However, Hell's Kitchen is an entirely different entity and the less you do to upset it, the better.<br>  <dd>   As for all of our returning readers, you already either knew this stuff or could have guessed. So why the hell are you wasting your time reading this token explanation for anyway?<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
