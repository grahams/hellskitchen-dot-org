In my mind, the stars have become rarified, so that when the burn mercilessly down through the orange glow of Advancement, it is like seeing a friend thought dead...or a vengeful god you never really believed in.<br> <dd>    I think it was in Ayn Rand's, The Fountainhead that one of the characters said that Fall was their favorite time of year. In Spring, man looks down, but in the Fall, man looks up. Prometheus made us with the ability to gaze into the heavens, and gave us the gift that would allow us to raze the gates of Olympus itself. For that, and other reasons, his banishment from his cousins comes to mind when the stars can be seen staring down uncaring. Still, we rejoice at the return of Persephone and lounge while Summer sits on the land like a fever.<br>   <dd>  For the Celts, the Fall marked a time of mystery and danger. The boundaries between our world and the world of Faerie slowly disappeared until Samhain, when one must beware, lest they be swept away into the Airey Realm. For me, Fall has always been a time, not of depression, but of introspection. The past threatens to corrupt the present by making itself felt; it is the time when love is most poignant, most felt, and indistinguishable from loss.<br>  <dD>   The crispness of morning. The dimmed sun. The smell of dried leaves resting on the ground, waiting for one to burry themselves in them. These are my memories and who I am.<br>   <dd>  Fall, for me, is not a time of year. It is an emotion...and sometimes a place.<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/fey.html"> Other Fey Denizen Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
