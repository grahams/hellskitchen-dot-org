The location is the Southern Baptists Super Secret Headquarters. Things are getting tense as ultra super-econo-sized conservatism is being dished onto everyone's plate with a big heap of gravy and a side of curly fries too big for any one man to eat (Shatner voice: "Good God man! Look at the size of that side!"). All in an attempt to get the Southern Baptist's bouncing ball rolling to boycott Disney because of Disney's policy toward gays.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images1/1.1.gif"><br><dd><I>   And you are there!</I>    <dd>   Not since McCarthy have there been this many sexually-repressed bible bearing, baby beating, beaver bonking members of the NRA in one room. And baby, let me tell you that's a lot of alliteration; not since McCarthy has there been that much alliteration. These are the few, the proud, the potentially dangerous people who will determine <I>your</I> future. Yes, children beware: for you stand in the very midst of evil itself. Make sure you wipe your feet before returning to your home.<br> <dd>  Endoubleayceepee be damned! This is white boy country. Every way the eye turns, it skims over pasty white men (each coincidentally with the quintessential Rush Limbaugh audience man generic haircut<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a>), with their NORM regulation issued PUDs... Fade out.  <br><dd>    The day is June 23rd, 1996. The location is a small church in the lone star state. There is an unearthly harmony raised by several members of the short-but ghostly-lumpy headed hooded hordes that are industriously bustling throughout the holy house's haunts.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images1/1.2.gif"><br>  <dd>    "HiiiiiiiHooooooooo..."<br>     <dd>  It echoes deeply for an eternity of moments and then a sudden roar of flames, Prometheus gone mad, reaching toward the heavens. Burn baby burn!<p>    <dd>     Could these two uniquely unrelated incidents be coincidence, or something much more insidious? Survey saaays...insidious.<br>   <dd>   To help deal with the imminent threat of the afore mentioned baby-beaters, Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Corp., has been accessing old Uncle Walt's (Disney, not Whitman. Give me a break. You wouldn't catch a reference to <I>Leaves of Grass</I> if it was going to crack you in the head.) wisdom using a series of off the shelf Motorola modems wired up to Walt's cryogenically frozen head.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a><br><IMG   align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images1/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    Disney's advice to Eisner comes in the form of broken thoughts and snatches of song...mainly "When you wish upon a star," "It's a Small World," and "Flubber is a damn fine idea." Using a crack army of washed up dream analysts and the PFN to interpret the bizarre pronouncements of Walt's Head&#153; ("Not many people know that pickle juice is good for feline leukemia...") Eisner, code named "Snow White," has called out the Mickey Mouse Club, code named "the Seven Dwarves," a specially trained assault group. In a project dubbed "Notre Dame," it was their intent to use scare tactics to force the whiny Baptist back down into the hole from whence they came. Arson, used for years to suppress Witches, pestilence, and rational thought, seemed the most effective means of doing it ("Flaming brands can be an effective cleanser for the rectum..."). Their program was such a huge success that the liberal media, always on the side of Disney and gays, was forced to take notice of the significant increase in unannounced Church weenie roasts.<br><dd>    The Seven Dwarfs were even able to indoctrinate thousands of small children world wide to the joys of church burning by orchestrating the scene in the summer of 1996's Disney movie, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" where the entire town is consumed by flame. Using subliminal images of candy bars and Santa drinking Coca-Cola, the scene of the burning of the Cathedral inspired many a tyke (Well, Sean) to scream out in a rock chewing frenzy within the confines of the theatre, "Vive la Revolution!"<br>   <dd>   ("I wish I'd taken a van of hermaphodite midgets and goat into the desert and filmed what happened.")<br>  <dd>     With the boycott of Disney by the Baptists in June of 1997,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> it is unclear what Disney will do to retaliate. Speculation, much like Richard Simmons, has once again run rampant. Although internal sources are reluctant to release too much information on the planned assault, we did manage to weasel out the code name for their next assault run, "Under the Sea."<br><dd>    Undercover sources indicate that the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Small World animatronic exhibits (now featuring the entire doll cast of Barbarella in the more up to date suspense thriller version of the Small World...complete with ethnic backgrounds and interracial turmoil. Watch as the Somali's face off with the Kerds, Serbs, and Israelis to settle the question of who the bigger assholes are.) may be used as weapons of revenge against the Baptists. Using secret nano-technology developed at Epcot, the creepy dolls of the Small World exhibit have been given the ability of self replication, autonomous movement and rudimentary decision making skills<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a> (using the same laser technology in Patriot Missiles, Smart Bombs&#153;, and Sagen Memorial Station's yappy dog). This evil army of singing manikins will swarm across the South, driving most Baptists screaming across the Midwest. The remaining Baptists will unfortunately have to deal with the now much more prominent Jehovah's Witness population. Like any ecosystem in which an ecological hole is left, the Jehovah's Witnesses will quickly diversify. Some projections show them quickly evolving into 12 foot "Terror-birds." Capable of reaching up to 70 knots and able to gut a cow with the swipe of a single modified wing claw, their calls of "Have you been saved?" will strike terror into the hearts of men.<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images1/1.4.gif"><br><dd>    It's hoped that many Baptists will suffer and die while crossing Death Valley in a journey we're certain the history books won't be dubbing the Trail of Gears.<br>   <dD>    For those religiously successful travelers who manage to pass through the desert, drinking the blood and urine of their fallen comrades, they will have to face Southern California and all of San Francisco's glory that is gay pride. There, thousands of Gay and Lesbian militiamen, trained by the newly released and reprogrammed Pirates of the Caribbean, will beat and enslave the dehydrated Baptists. The Baptist females will then be used as sex slaves by dominatrix lesbians, while the baptist males are not allowed to watch (now that's torture!). After being satisfied, the Baptists, filled with confusing sexual longings,  will be driven to the sea and forced to clean up crude oil spills, pick up hypodermic needles, and constantly take water purity readings of water that is obviously contaminated with human wastes.<br>   <dd>   Many of these forlorn individuals will end up throwing their tortured souls to the waves to take them where God may. These would be Baptist martyrs will be dragged down to the ocean floor by playful dolphins and sea otters, and offered up as homage to the great animals of the depths. Their mutilated noggins will then be utilized to make the percussion sounds necessary to reproduce the piscine world's biggest musical hit, "Under the Sea."<p>  <dd>   The year is 2002. The location is Washington D.C.. Congress has just awarded the now bedraggled group of surviving Southern Baptist members a homeland and <I>you are there</I>. Now they can live their lives free of persecution, sell duty-free cigarettes, open casinos, and try to farm on land yielding only tumbleweeds.<br>   <dD>   The Pope has recently retracted his early statement in 1998 on the treatment of the Southern Baptists as being, "God's will" and, "...about bloody time." He excused his often vicious criticism of the Southern Baptists by admitting that he has been suffering from a particularly nasty case of religion specific turrets syndrome. He then ended his press conference by saying, "The Israelis are a mitochondrial pool of heathen scum and they deserve to be masticated while still alive, but don't anyone worry, because I happened to have a rather nice conversation with God today and he said they'd all be going to hell anyway."<br>  </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Short back and sides on both sides, draw no winner. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164;</A> On an unrelated note, Walt Disney's body (minus said head) has been hooked up to power southern Florida since it started spinning around the time that "Mighty Ducks Two" began  filming, and is now known as the sixth renewable energy resource.
