The editors mistakenly assumed that the lead singer of the "Frantic Flattops" was still dating an acquaintance of theirs. Unfortunately, this is not true. Evidentialy Mr. Flattop has a hankering for platinum blondes, so the woman mentioned in <I>Reporter Magazine</I> and ridiculed in GDT are not the same person. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused the blonde in question.<p><dD>We're sure she's quite bedable.<br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/10/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
