The suddenness of this decision has turned off many students to even considering the idea. <LI> Most students are under the misconception that these "policy meetings" that various organizations on campus are holding are to express their opinion of whether or not drinking should be allowed on campus. That question was answered when President Simone handed down RIT's new alcohol policy. I think the policy meetings are really after opinions of RIT's draft of the permanent policy. Unfortunately, students will continue to debate a moot point. <LI> I'll be closely watching Student Government's recommendations to President Simone. This will be a true test of SG's actual political power in RIT affairs, as well as how closely the top floor of the Eastman Building really believes their slogan "You're Our #1 PrioRITy." <li> Isn't it ironic that RIT Food Service and RIT Catering are still allowed to sell alcohol to students on campus? I'll also be keeping a close eye on the handling of this matter, as it will clearly show RIT's motive behind this new policy. Is it really to create a better learning environment, or to more closely protect RIT from a lawsuit? If RIT can't give up a source of income to show full support for its own policy, I'd have to say it's the latter.</UL><br><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
