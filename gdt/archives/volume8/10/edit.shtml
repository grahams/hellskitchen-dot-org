We've officially finished another one and boy are our minds tired. Hell's Kitchen, however, is still going to be putting out a few more issues in this volume, so be on the lookout for `um.<br>  <dD>   Next quarter we start on volume 9 and get that much closer to our 100th issue. Just to get your salivary glands watering I've decided to give you a quick peek at the future of Gracies Dinnertime Theatre.<br><UL><LI>History for Dyslexics - a new column to be started next quarter that will delve into the history of this tiny blue-green orb. Its religious, scientific, and miscellaneous heritage will be brutified by a professional Spoonerist for your personal reading satisfaction.<LI> Be All That You Can Be - GDT will give you a quick trip through the dogma of the Armed Forces.

It seems that in some unknown manner a very special member of the vermin world dropped in to pay a visit (ie. we found a bat in the tub). It was quite small and rather perturbed at our uncouth behavior, and after we scanned it, we set it loose to wreak havoc where ever it went.
