I don't care if Halloween was last weekend.  Screw you.  Haven't you heard of the anti-climax?  (Those of you who have had your mother walk in on you while you were "enjoying" the latest Victoria Secret catalog know what it is.)  Anyway, it really isn't anticlimatic because I'm writing this on Halloween; it's your fault that you get it one week later, so neyahhh. Let me just start by saying that there has yet to be a film that is more fun to watch than Sam Rami's cult classic "Army of Darkness".  There is one reason and one reason only for this.  The Ash aesthetic.<br><dd>Picture yourself as a man ever accosted by the evil forces of the universe, relentlessly pursued, constantly antagonized, tormented beyond sanity. Add the fact that your normal life consists of working in the housewares department of S-Mart (Shop smart, shop S - Mart), and you've mastered the art of the vernacular, and you have our hero.  Ash is by far the most stoic protagonist since Bond himself.  Sure, Bond would get a witty sarcasm in every once and a while, but never would he utter, "Come get some," to any would be soul-swallowing foe.  The entire film consists of Ash saying some of the best one-liners ever, then getting the living shit kicked out of him.<br><dd>    One-liner, shit kick.  One-liner, shit kick.  You see the simple formula here?  I do, as do millions of AOD fans everywhere. The previous films, Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were good.  The first made an honest attempt at a genuinely scary horror film, even going as far as arborphilia - sex with trees!  The second film was the first film all over again, but with a better sense of humor.  This can be seen by the hap-hazard placement of lighting rigs and props, as well as cheezy-beyond-cheezy special defects.  The third in the series, AOD, married the cheezy special effects to the cheese meister himself, Bruce Campbell.  His portrayal of the demon-stricken Ash was breathtaking.<br><dD>     <B>"First you want to kill me, then you want to kiss me.  Blow."</B><br>   <dD>  Pure genius.<br>  <dD>   <B>"Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."</B><br>   <dD>  The muse was with him.<br> <dD>    And the quinticential(sic) word uttered during outstandingly  favorable circumstances:<br>  <dD>   <B>"Groovy."</B><br>    <dd>  Folks, you can't beat that.  Not at all.  So I offer you a challenge this day.  See if you can go for one day talking exactly like Ash.  I guarantee it would be real fun.  One whole day of Ash-esque lingo.  It would be pure poetry:<br>  <table width = 250><tr><td valign = top width = 5></td><td valign = top><B>Friend:</B> Wanna go get something to eat?<br><B>You:</B> Let's get some.<br><B>Friend:</B> I'm so sorry to hear about your dead Uncle.<br><B>You:</B> Shit happens.

It will put a smile on your face, and a chainsaw on your arm!  So spend a day communing with the little Ash inside each and every one of us.  Drop the Oldsmobile.<br><center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images10/tourist2.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>Shop S-Mart</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table></center></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/10/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
