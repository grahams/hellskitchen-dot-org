Alex is obviously in charge and showing Kelly around.</I><br><B>Kelly:</B>  Hmmm. Quite a colour scheme you've got going here.<br> <B>Alex:</B> Do you like how I never finished the gold? You know, it's typical when people come and look at it and I'm, like, "You know? This is the art student's trailer," and then they understand it. I wanted to paint it silver and black so it would look like some sort of old diner. I kind of like it.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah. It's got a special kind of sheik to it. <I>(Staring at the paint)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> As sheik as a trailer can get. But the paint never dries. Its been on here like a year.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Well, I think it dries. It just keeps coming off.<br><B>Alex:</B> So is that dry? It never says. <I>(Steps over a mousetrap)</I> Watch your feet.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Is this like a spray paint thing? <I>(Still fixated on the silver paint)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> No. Its a paint called "Supercoat" that you buy at Wegmans. It's got a silver quality.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Let me guess, this is gold leaf?<br><B>Alex:</B> Ahhh, same brand. It's like 5$ for this much. <I>(Holds thumb and index finger out)</I> I ran out of money. I ran out of money, and I'm not willing to pay $100 to paint this little thing. <I>(Points to ceiling)</I> So this is plumbing that's running along the wall.<br> <B>Kelly:</B> Hmmm. The brick...ahh, the brick work comes up. <I>(pointing to plastic-like brick wallpaper)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> That's where you put your simulated fire place.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Ah ha.<br><B>Alex:</B> Brick veneer.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Did you put this on?<br><B>Alex:</B> No, this was here.<br><B>Kelly: </B>That was there?<br><B>Alex:</B> The only think I ever changed was the paint colour.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Ah ha.<br><B>Alex:</B> Look at the hallway. That's what I want to do to the floor in the attic.<br><B>Kelly:</B> The walls to the hallway? That's great.<br><B>Alex:</B> Don't you love it?<br><B>Kelly:</B> They're neat.... They're really neat.<br><B>Alex:</B> Ok. So this wall comes down so you can have like the Extra Large Trailer Living Arena.&#153; Which would be, like, I don't know...like 50 square feet then?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Hmmm. How do they come down?<br><B>Alex:</B> It just pops up.<br> <B>Kelly:</B> Course the colour scheme would be all off....<br><B>Alex:</B> Well, you could get more paint. Hey, look at this: if you push hard enough, you can, like, get the wall and floor to separate. But we're not going to do that cause it might fall off or something.<br><B>Kelly:</B> And small children could fall through there.<br><B>Alex:</B> Exactly. That's the emergency exit.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Are you taking this with you? <I>(Pointing to a mysterious object that looks something like a hydra, something like a shoe tree, and something like a oversize shoehorn)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> Umm, I don't know. Do you want it?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Mmmm. I don't really need anything that that.<br><B>Alex:</B> Oh, that's right. You don't even wear shoes.<br><B>Kelly:</B> I like the purple. <I>(entering the bathroom)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> I love the purple.<br><B>Kelly:</B> That's really cool. What are all the words about?<br><B>Alex:</B> They're French. They just label whatever: mirror, wash, towel, shower, toilet...<br> <B>Kelly:</B> La Douche?<br><B>Alex: </B>Just to clear up any confusion.<br><B>Kelly:</B> This is helpful...really.<br><B>Alex:</B> Here's the Floor Spring Action.&#153;<br><B>Kelly:</B> Oh. You don't need a mattress here. You can actually just use your floor.<br><B>Alex:</B> No, you could just use the floor. <I>(opens closet door)</I><br><B>Kelly:</B> So if you jump up and down on a spot on the floor you can actually fall through.<br><B>Alex: </B><I>(Ignoring her)</I> See the bedroom door doubles as the closet door.<br> <B>Kelly:</B> Ahh, how ingenious.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><IMG  width = 500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images2/attic.gif"><br>   <TABLE WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td valign = top> <multicol cols=2 gutter=8><B>Alex:</B> Yeah it is.<br> <B>Kelly:</B> Were you going to paint the ceiling all silver or-<br><B>Alex:</B> I felt like I did the edges and I just couldn't decide how I wanted it done.<br><B>Kelly:</B> You just went from wobbly to-<br><B>Alex:</B> Yeah. It's half and half.<br><B>Kelly: </B>Oh! You've got ants!<br><B>Alex:</B> Do I?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah.<br><B>Alex:</B> Ew. Yuck. Good thing I don't live here anymore. Do you want to know why? There's like a hole here. <I>(Pointing to the floor)</I><br><B>Kelly:</B> Mmm. This is another place I should hop up and down? <I>(Several inches shorter than before)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> You don't need to hop up and down.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Oh yeah, they're coming from there. <I>(Examining the fabled entryway for the ants)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> Are they? Oh well. No one ever looks that closely when they look at it. Cover it up. We don't want you to look there. We don't look at those problems. You see, we're in Trailer Denial.&#153;<br><B>Kelly:</B> Ahhh. You've got some other interesting holes.<br><B>Alex:</B> Ok. Don't look.<br><B>Kelly:</B> I like the green door. <I>(looking at the closet/bedroom door)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> Thanks.<br><B>Kelly:</B> It really adds a nice contrast to the rest of the room.<br> <B>Alex:</B> The other 18 colours?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah. This is quite an experience walking through the hall.<br><B>Alex:</B> I think if I do this- Sean said its like tripping going through this hall.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah, no kidding.<br><B>Alex: </B>Um. I think for the attic floor I should do off white and black and then do silver where they meet. That would be really neat.<br><B>Kelly:</B> A little thin line of silver?<br><B>Alex:</B> Yup, and then right at the three peaks of the roof we could do something. That would be kind of cool.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah.<br><B>Alex:</B> And the walls too are going to be off white.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Oh this is so freaky. The walls are melting....<br><B>Alex: </B>Do you like how it comes down?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Yeah I do. I like it. I like how this comes up and how that goes down. <I>(Totally tripping out at this point)</I><br><B>Alex:</B> Yup. Alan and I painted this. It was totally fun.<br><B>Kelly:</B> I can tell. I've got to get out of here now.<br><B>Alex:</B> Ok. So I'm leaving all the blinds. I'm leaving the appliances. But I'm pretending I'm trying to sell them to see if I can get money out of anyone.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Mmmm. What appliances are they?<br><B>Alex:</B> There's a stove, there's a fridge, there's a waterheater, there's a furnace. As if I would actually, like, want to take the waterheater with me. Isn't this funky? <I>(Gesturing to the interior of the trailer in general)</I><br><B>Kelly: </B>Yeah. Very mobile too.<br><B>Alex:</B> Yup. The stove is only nineteen years old too.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Is it gas?<br><B>Alex:</B> Propane.<br><B>Kelly:</B> Cool.<br><B>Alex: </B>There's a groove here in the floor, but I just have something here because of the ah-<br><B>Kelly:</B> It looks like somebody hit the wall and then slid down.<br><B>Alex:</B> Yeah. That was from my little murder spree. Should I give you a tour of the tail lights?<br><B>Kelly:</B> Sure.<br><B>Alex:</B> They used to be really nice, but then um...when I was painting the trailer with my friend, Laura painted over them. <I>(Pointing out the window)</I><br><B>Kelly:</B> You could scrape it off couldn't you?<br><B>Alex:</B> If I wanted to I could.<br> <B>Kelly:</B> Um, is the tour done inside?<br><B>Alex:</B> Do you have any further questions?<br><B>Kelly: </B>Well every time I poke a little bit you say, "Well, we don't look at those things here."<br><B>Alex:</B> Just look with your eyes and not your hands.<br><B>Kelly:</B> It's ok if you don't get yourself too close.<br><B>Alex:</B> Yeah, and don't comment on the insects.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
