The alliance, which shocked many of the attendees of DonWorld 97, was signed just days before the start of the annual national celebration in Donland.<br>  <dd>    "We have to let go of the notion that, in order for Donland to win, Hell's Kitchen has to lose," quipped Don last week.<br>              <dd>  Under the terms of the agreement, struggling home page Donland is allowing Hell's Kitchen member publication Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre(GDT) to republish various news, commentary, and other materials from Donland's Buzz section in its weekly publication. In return, Donland receives free public media attention and, for whatever it's worth, Hell's Kitchen will make Donland it's official online homeland.<br>   <dd>  While some residents of Donland expressed disappointment and outrage at the announcement by booing the Supreme Dictator's speech, many analysts are upbeat about the alliance. C. Diablo, publisher of Hell's Kitchen, was on hand via satellite to praise the new alliance. "This marks a new era in the history of both Donland and Hell's Kitchen."<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
