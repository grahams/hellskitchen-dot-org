But I have faith in you, fair reader. I know that you can keep up.<br> <dd>    First and foremost, I want to apologize for the slap-shod way GDT (via Hell's Kitchen) was distributed last week. As I write this, there are still some issues that haven't reached their destination. Most of you probably don't care, but one of the reasons GDT strives to publish material every week, and distribute on time, is because we are an unconventionial publication. When readers describe GDT, or Hell's Kitchen, they invariably use the word "'zine" (even though the Kitchen can be as long as some local student run magazines (minus their ads)).<br> <dd>    Admittedly, GDT is 'zinish in quality. We are irreverent, vulgar, and written by "X-ers." However, we are also dedicated to putting material out every week...a decidedly un 'zinish quality.<br>   <dd>   There have only been two times when we were late in distributing issues. The first time was in 1995 when Marc Trzepla, our illustrator at the time, was gone for a day; that week, GDT stood for "Got Delayed Today." Last issue was our second late day. Not bad for almost 100 issues in two and a half years.<br> <dd>    Most of you don't care, but we do. We wouldn't be doing GDT weekly if we thought it didn't matter. Sure, in the grand scheme of the universe, 20,000 years from now, a gastropod on some un-named planet orbiting a distant star isn't going to care about our self-imposed deadlines, but we do. We do the best we can with what we have.<br>   <dd>  For what it's worth, we were late, not because of laziness on our part, but because we have been more successful than we had realized. Periodically we increase our circulation as funds increase. Sometimes we expand into new areas (like MCC), sometimes we simply increase the number of issues we put in an old area. As of last issue we passed the half-kilo mark for the first time, and the good people at the University of Rochester's Copy Center simply couldn't finish the order by when we needed them. Themselves readers, several apologized, but I knew it was our fault, not theirs.<br> <dd>    So, we've adjusted our schedule and don't plan on running into and delays for the rest of the year. You'll get your fix at the start of each week, instead of at the middle of it.<p>   <dd>   Now, for a quick change of pace, I have something to say about Princess Di. Ah-hum: some woman who's only claim to fame was that she married, and then divorced a prince dies and the world goes bonkers thanks to the press. Meanwhile, Mother Teresa, a woman whose sainthood is assured, who is seen as an incarnation of Vishnu, and who is revered in every major (and most minor) religions of the world, dies and is given a PS is the media. How is that cool? The good Mother and the dead Di can't even be compared. And don't give me that crap about Princess Di speaking out against landmines. Thousands of people speak out about man's inhumanity to man or his apathy toward the suffering of others. Shit, the image of Sally Struthers, tears and mascara running down her pudgy cheeks as she weeps about starving children is burned into my retinas, but I'm sure that not every flower in the US will be killed to create a massive, yet sweet smelling, organic shrine when she dies. Princess Di was simply so followed but lens wielding jackals that she got the coverage. And to hell with her being a beauty: her greatest beauty feature was that she was British and still had all her teeth.<br>  <dd>    I'm being more cruel than is necessary, but I'm indignant about the whole thing. It is sad whenever someone is lost to those that love them. However, I find it sadder that our society idealizes the life of Princess Di more than the life of Mother Teresa. Despite all the dresses she auctioned off, Princess Di didn't <I>indirectly</I> help a fraction of the people that Mother Teresa helped <I>in person</I>.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
