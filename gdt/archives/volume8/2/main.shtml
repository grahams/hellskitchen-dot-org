We found (through unscrupulous sources, the proverbial cream of the crop (eewww)) that some mysterious group has been pumping heap-big slabs o' wampum into Hell's Kitchen. At first we weren't worried. Hey, what the hell do we care? It all goes to pay for printing anyway. But we started getting a bit suspicious when our fund-raiser Tom Kar Kai said, "So guys, now that we've got the funds to, say, buy a small Latin American country, don't you think it would be a hoot if we...I don't know...invaded Quebec? We could buy a tank and make a weekend of it!"<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images2/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    After tying old Tom down and performing mild surgery on him<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> ("We don't need this, or this..."), it turned out that our good old friend Mr. Kar Kai was actually a deep cover operative from Canada (yes, O Canada) sent to infiltrate Hell's Kitchen and induce us to vomit and invade Quebec. <br><dd>   Doesn't make sense, I hear the guy in the back writing? Oh, but think about it: micro-nationalism in Quebec has been on the rise over the past several decades, and the English-speaking people in Canada's Heartland wish the Frogs would just get their act together and finally pass their periodic referendums and get the hell out. Sick of waiting, the right-minded English inhabitants of Canada have turned to their southern, more aggressive brethren (i.e., small US non-profit organizations) to drive the beret-bearing bastards into the sea. Besides, if the US is busy invading Quebec and bringing it a little backwoods justice,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> we won't invade the rest of their shitty country for a while longer; we're still licking our wounds from 1812.<br><dd>    It's not just Quebec, though. All over the world the Super-nationalism of the early part of the 20th century is being replaced by micro-nationalism. Ireland, Israel, Azerbaijan, the Kurds (small and large), Serbs.... It's Balkanization for everybody! Free side order of fries, and if you order now you'll receive these lovely faux pearls. Guaranteed to satisfy even your most discerning swine. Really, what would the Kurds do if Turkey and Iraq were to grant them independence...besides be land-locked and have no exports? They can't just let their entire economy be led by Reebok and their soccer ball sewing hordes. They'd just be another Tuva; and we all know what that leads to: throat singing and no rhythm (...sounds like a truck full of windchimes hitting a flock of ducks...).<br>  <dd>   Everyone is so interested in not stepping on the ethnicity of others that more and more subgroups are created. Sure, you might be a single unitarian north eastern Afro-American, and I'm an atheist unitoothed malproportioned Irish-American git, but that doesn't mean that all atheist unitoothed malproportioned Irish-American gits should get together and form a country. People are confusing clubs and support organizations with ethnic identity. You're Palestinian and I'm a Jew? Ok, get over it. You're just another slacker to me.<br><center><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images2/1.2.gif"></center><br><dd>    Some people blame it on the inherent selfish nature of man (Yes. Man, not people. "Man" is an herstorically acceptable plural, all encompassing word). Me? I blame the Canadians and the Christians (pig fuckers!). In the course of our, um, discrete questioning of Tom, you remember Tom, ("You always thought about the Priesthood, didn't you Tom?"), we discovered that the Canadians, bitter about their problems with Quebec, have been causing it all. The assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand? Yup. A Canadian, not a Serb; if you can get a Canuck to grow his mustache, take his tuque off, and peal that ridiculous flannel off him, your average Canadian is actually a dead ringer for any vindictive, gun tote'n, arch duke shoot'n Serb (...you've got to capitalize 'Serb' cause they think their an ethnic group...).<br>   <dd>   You see, over the years Canada's major exports have been geese, Labatt beer, devalued currency, hockey, and Alex Trebek. This has led to the unfortunate situation where most of the people living in Canada spend much of their time walking on goose doots and willingly spending coinage called Loonies and Molsen. The high amounts of ammonia absorbed through the skin (from the goose-doots, stupid!) has led to the government of Canada being filled mostly with murderous old codgers who would rather go on killing rampages during their scheduled nightly nap hour than share their country with a bunch of baguette eating prats who have no more sense than to speak French (...you've got to capitalize 'French' cause they think their an ethnic group...<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a>) all of the live long day.<br>  <dd>   <I>&#60;breath&#62; &#60;/breath&#62;</I><br><dd>    Because misery loves company, Canada, in conjunction with Hell Inc., has formed the Pandora Group: a collection of Canada's best and most luminous, bent on going out into the world to spread VeeDee and discord where ever they go. Some recent manifestations of the Pandora Group in American culture have been Beanie-Babies, Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, and the insanely oversized computer programs coming from Microsoft. The Pandora Group's major function, however, has been the promotion of balkanization worldwide.<br>  <dd>   Just to show you how devious these bastards are, it took only three operatives in minor positions in Austria posing as art teachers and critics in the nineteen teens to set the ball rolling for World War 2 (remember, at the same time they primed Europe's engines by starting WWI). It wasn't the war they were after, though that was a nice side of gravy. What they wanted was the establishment of a Jewish homeland to displace the Palestinians and piss off the Arab countries forever.<br>  <dd>   So remember: behind every Palestinian throwing a rock at a Jewish invader, behind every English cursing Scot, behind every rifle hugging militia man and every politically correct fairy-tale, there lies a Canadian waiving his stupid maple-leaf flag. Oops! Got to run. Tanks all gassed up and we've some Frogs to fry.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Well, not really funny "Ha-Ha."
