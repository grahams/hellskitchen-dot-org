Oh, here we go...um, no, too guilt-wridden."<br>  <dd>  My search came up fruitless. I own over 500 CD's and I couldn't find one disc of complete happiness. Sure, there are individual tracks and even whole sides of albums (yes, there was a time when people listened to sides of an album, way back in the days of 25&#162; Cokes and Commodore 64's) that have an uplifting spirit, but there's always a song thrown in to bring the mood right back down (invariably my favorite song from said album).<br>   <dd>   What is this melancholia I adore? All of the artists I listen to on a regular basis are overwrought with self-doubt, humiliation, loneliness, focused anger or blind rage. I love to wallow in the thoughts and ideas of a forlorn world seen through the eyes of self-obsessed, introspective whiners lamenting anything and everything as some kind of twisted personal tragedy. I can bring this abstraction into focus as a reality for you, by explaining that I could sum up my life with just the titles of songs from the Smiths catalogue (and yes, it would still begin with "Never had no one ever"...).<br>   <dd>   I've been told countless times that this is simply a phase that most everyone goes through; that a little happiness never hurt anyone, blah, blah , blah. Fuck Happiness for happiness' sake (Or as my friend Dan would so eloquently state, "Hope is for suckers").<br>   <dd>   Sadness fits me like an old wool sweater. It doesn't itch and provides the perfect respite from the chill of the day. I am comfortable in the drowsiness of melancholy. I'm sure that someday I'll look back on my foolishness and laugh at how short-sighted and wrapped up in my own false importantness I was. Until that day I'll continue to create self portraits full of self-mutilation and decay, revel in the sorrow of Requiem masses and fulfill physical needs through the depraved outlet of pain, my only mistress.<br>   <dd>   Maybe I've just been living with cats for too long....<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/2/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/tl.html">Troy Liston</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
