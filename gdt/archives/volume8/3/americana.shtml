The next day, I'm heading into a huge grocery superstore to get supplies for my summer apartment.  The shelves are jammed with products and it takes me five minutes to choose from the 75 different brands of soap because I'm not used to having more than two choices.  In the produce section, fruit is stacked so high I realize that half of it is going to be crushed just to keep up the idea of unlimited supply.<br>     <dd>  Dazed by an overload of signs, labels, oversaturated colors and the staggering vision of fat people (nowhere else in the world will you find so many people so horrifyingly overweight as in this country), I find myself wandering confused and slackjawed through the aisles, like a child in shellshock.  Stopping to find out what they put in cranapple juice, I'm jammed against the aisle by two women adamant about pushing their carts past each other.  The PA pipes along about specials in the butcher shop and the air is filled with a disorienting stench of chemical-rich cleaning products.  Concentrating on the label, I read it back to myself: "Cranberry juice, water, apple juice, high-fructose corn syrup, pork sausage, sodium sorbate, natural flavors and preservatives."<br>   <dd>   Beaten and confused, I leave the store with a small sack of fruit and soap. Scurrying to my car, I wonder why my eyes feel so overwhelmed by the information-dense landscape.<br>  <dd>    America again.<br>   <dD>   That night I dream of Maggi. She's standing on the platform in Sofia Centralna station, holding my hand out the train window.  The train pulls away slowly while her eyes fill with tears.  My hand is pulled away from her, and she stands silent, eyes flushed and her face a brittle mask for what's screaming beneath it all.  The train seems to move in slow motion and I watch her leave me in reverse for hours.<br>     <dd>   Maggi!  You'll always be the best part of a dream I left behind...<p> June 29th , 1997-<br>  <dd>   Driving home from a late movie, I see a sight that has always fascinated me: a huge highway interchange.  A great coiling tangle of concrete which holds the skyline like some terrifying ancient ruin.  Hot-lit in sodium vapour floodlights, it's an alien shape in a coldly spotless world of glowing signs, dark streets and parked cars.  The air is warm and still, and after parking the car by the side of the highway, only the swish of a few passing cars brings any wind through the open window.<br>    <dd>  I wonder what Maggi would think if she could see it.  The William Orbit tape drones along and my evening shave remains smooth to fingertips.  The concrete superstructure is suddenly symbolic of everything that is so different about these two cultures.  One day there may be supermarkets and computerized checkouts in Bulgaria.  But there will never be highways that stretch across the sky like angry serpents.<br>     <dd>   I'm still not sure if I'm glad to be back home.  Sometimes America seems like a delusion.<p> August 7th, 1997-<br>   <dd>   In the midst of a long horrendous drive across the New Mexico desert, I stop the car on a small overlook that is filled by a sweeping view of mesas, blue sky and incredible clouds.  The sun is a hammer, and the air is dry and unforgiving.<br>   <dd>   Slipping off my clothes I can feel moisture being sucked from me by the merciless environment.  My camera is perched on the hood, set on a timer. Ass to the camera, in the middle of the long, snaky highway, I bask in the heat, waiting for the "shloop-click" of the shutter.  The sun and sky make time stretch out and my mind is crowded with memories of a childhood under these huge Western skies.<br>   <dd>   "Shloop-Click" says the camera.<br>     <dD>  I was wrong.  I still love this country.  And my heart will always return to the deserts and blue skies of America.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/americana.html"> Other Americana Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
