So, like, two years ago I was at Thanksgiving at my aunt's house in Massachusetts and I have this other aunt I love to shop with cause she loves to shop almost as much as me. And the rest of the family can't deal with shopping with either one of us.<br>    <dD>  So we went shopping.<br>   <dD>   And, ok: We're at the mall and I see this Kenneth Cole store. And I needed shoes but I wasn't really going to buy shoes 'cause I can't afford shoes. So I saw this pair of shoes that were shiny black. And, like, I'm a little bird: I'm attracted to anything shiny. I'm like, "Must have these shoes." So. But they were like super expens-<br>(The phone rings.)<br> <dd>    Phone. Phone. Phone. Tell'um to go away.<br>(Someone answers the phone.)<br>  <dd>   So, ok. I try them on, and my aunt's like, "Oh, Kenneth Cole.... These are the best shoes ever." So, I buy the shoes; I'm all happy; I go home. And of course since I buy my own Christmas presents I find someone to reimburse me for them. So I didn't really buy them entirely. Only a little bit.<br> <dd>    So I'm wearing them. And they are true items of beauty. And, ah, like, the patch in back starts to crack, and I'm like, "Ok, well, I'm too lazy to do anything about it." But then the sole starts to rip, and I'm like, "This is absurd. Shoes that cost this much...we really should have quality."<br> <dd>    So I call the company and they're like, "No. You have to go back to the store you bought them in and return them." And I'm like, "The store's nine hours away. I'm not going to drive there  to return a pair of shoes." And she's like, "Did you charge them?" And I'm like, "Yeah." And she's like, "Well, call your credit card and they'll tell you where you bought it whatever, whatever." But I didn't even know what card I charged it on, and I wasn't about to look it up. So I got mad and hung up. Then I called them back again after and I'm like, "This is stupid. I'm not driving to the store." So they had me send them to their headquarters in Jerrrrzzzey.<br> <dd>    They kept them for, like, four months. And finally they were like, "Well, we're fixing them," and they sent them back with this crappy glue on them.<br>    <dd>  Two weeks later they fell apart, and like, the whole sole fell off. And shoes that cost $150 shouldn't fall apart like that. I've had shoes like that that lasted 4 years. That's why you spend $150 on shoes.<br>  <dd>   So I called them back again. And I yelled at them. And I said, "Shoes that cost this much shouldn't fall apart." She's like, "Write a letter to the President." And I said, "I think I will." So I got his address and I sent the shoes back, and they're like, "Oh. These are defective."<br>  <dd>   But they didn't have any shoes left, and I loved that pair of shoes, and that's all I wanted. So they sent me a credit for any pair of shoes up to a certain amount of money, whatever, whatever, and a catalog. And all the shoes in the catalog just were not what I wanted. And the only pair of shoes I wanted were some golf shoes...that weren't in my size. My feet are bigger than most people's.<br>  <dD>   I didn't order anything. Then I get the next catalog. This took, like, four months. Finally I ordered another pair of shoes. And I'm waiting, and waiting, and they finally came. The UPS man delivered them and I told him the whole shoe story I'm telling you now. He's like, "Uh-huh. Ok. Thanks," and left. So I'm so excited to have them, and I have them.<br>   <dd>  Ya' love'um?<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <center><IMG   SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images3/attic.gif"><br></center><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
