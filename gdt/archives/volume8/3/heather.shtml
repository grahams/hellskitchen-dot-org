I wonder whether I follow the rules simply because I have been doing just that for so many years, or if there are valid reasons somewhere in my head, and how much weight those reasons have. I have never tried drinking, smoking, or taking drugs. I suppose that during high school that may have been due to lack of exposure. Very few of the people I spent time with did those things or at least did them rarely.<br><dd>     As long as I can remember I have thought of those habits as self-detrimental, childish, and just plain stupid. I am definitely not tempted to try cigarette smoking. Most of the people I know who are smokers want to quit and don't gain anything from smoking...other than respite from nicotine withdrawal. I do find myself curious about alcohol and some drugs. When used in moderation the things I am interested in don't appear to be detrimental. Also, isn't it childish to refuse to try new things, since I don't even know what they are like? Yet I think that I would be sacrificing some of my self-respect if I allowed myself to have some of these experiences. I can understand why I don't approve of abuse of these substances, but what is wrong with moderate consumption periodically to enjoy altered sensations? It's not like my parents preached at me and beat these beliefs through my still soft skull into my unformed brain, or like they abused these substances and I am attempting to avoid repeating their fate. At this point in my life I enjoy being able to say I don't drink (and never have aside from sips of coffee brandy with milk and Bud from my parents when I was little) and don't do drugs or smoke except second hand. It provides me with a sense of accomplishment and some notoriety, especially since I have been working at a bar for more than a year.<br> <dd>    I think that fear may play a part in my continued abstinence. I fear addiction (at least while looking at myself from inside my head, I seem to have a moderately addictive personality). I fear doing things that may cause me to lose respect for myself. My inhibitions are few enough and I am satisfied with the things I will and won't let myself do and have the courage to do. I'm very afraid of surrendering the reins of control in my life, but I feel that loosening my white knuckled grip could be beneficial. Even with this collection of fears, I still contemplate trying, but no reason seems monumental enough or just plain strong enough to get me to change the way I have lived the first 22 years of my life. Still, I feel that I may be denying myself some pleasure to be able to stand on my moral high ground...alone.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/3/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/hd.html">Heather Danielson</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
