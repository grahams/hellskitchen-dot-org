The plebian school system lost its <I>raison d'etre</I> since corporal punishment was limited.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Gone are the days when teachers could take slackers, free thinkers, and retarded children out into the hall and beat the living BeeGeesus out of them. Teachers, now limited to psychological torture, sleep deprivation,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a> and high-power microwaves, aren't even allowed to fail students anymore...lest they damage the fragile egos of their tender, pistol-carrying wards.<br> <IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images3/1.1.gif"><br><dd>   Higher education should, well, for starters, be on a higher level than it is today. Public education needs a better system, faster teachers, with more arms, damnit!<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a> In order to get all that, it requires gads of cash. They could always try to get an NEA grant by calling classes a "creative happening," an exercise in absurdity if you will, but that kind of money is fleeting and fades fast-it couldn't possibly support all the public school systems across the nation. Hell, <I>we're</I> public education and are still waiting for RIT's Creative Arts Committee to finally approve the grant we sent in months ago.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a> After two years of printing they forget we exist? Oh God, the Republicans are winning! We've got to rally, guys!<br>  <dd>   Anywho.<br> <dd>    What the educational system really needs is to start thinking in bigger terms and begin considering the bottom line. I think it's high time they cash in on public interests. The majority of the legislative bodies of our government have all kowtowed before commercialization, and it's time education got a little more greedy.<br> <IMG width = 300 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Inner-city public transport long ago recognized the inherent possibilities in being moving blitverts; they go zipping by and people are having seizures and exploding in their wake thanks to the intellectual doppler effect caused by the mind-numbing ads on their sides (the buses, not the people, stupid). The yellow behemoths of our childhood should sell advertising spaces on their sides and rear, effectively becoming Camel wagons. Just imagine Joe Camel in all his malproportioned splendor plastered all over the outside of juvenile transportation, while the insides are packed with noisy, boisterous, nubile, young scholars...all anticipating the first day of grade K. What's that you say? Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man have been given a restraining order against being in the presence of small children?<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a> Don't worry about it. Just remember: Joe and Mr. Marlboro are only on the outside of the bus, while Junior is safely nestled inside. Kids won't see the nicotine-stained role models in the bus, although they're liable to see the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers perched above the window just to the right of Ronald McDonald's smiling mug and an old ad for Planned Parenthood, while Barney and the Burger King Kids Club tend to mope about the emergency exits.<br>  <dd>    That's only the beginning of the fun. Schools themselves would almost become paid advertisements. Gone is the era in which students, in a frenzy of school spirit, would paint a jovial mural on one wall of the school indicating the importance of school and community in any fledgling student's life (Oh, Mr. B). Now those murals are covered up...by paying customers. Nike's just bought the right to embellish the entire front of the high school with it's trademark schwing. Gap and Gitano line the walls leading to the lunchroom, which itself looks like a giant montage. With overabundant phrases on the walls spilling such pearls of wisdom as "Real food for real people," and "Soup is good food," it's no surprise that the youth are beefcake. Beefcake!<br>   <dd>  The classrooms are far more reserved than the rest of the school in that each classroom may only have one sponsor to paper its walls-with style. Back in the elementary school the kids in the first grade always enjoy a good game of "Spot the Stealth Bomber," in their room tastefully decorated by the US Armed Forces. Strapping, buff soldiers cheerily encourage the pupils to be "all they can be" while standing aloft a large tank and caressing their trusted assault rifle, Charlene, in some tropical island paradise where young native boys are at their beck and call.  Phallic symbols abound....<br><IMG  width = 300 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images3/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    In later years, highschool teachers have to double as announcers in the tradition of the early Soap Operas. After twenty minutes of discussion, the Ecology professor pauses to thank Mobile Oil for their generous support. Mobile Oil: working to protect endangered wetlands by drilling the crap out of them. In Earth Science, DeBeers is footing the bill, and Microsoft is coughing up the dough to sponsor the math classes and guidance counselors. "Where do you want to go today?"<br><dd>   Taking a more subtle route, the text books for Health are supplied by Trojan and the makers of KY Jelly (With a name like KY, it's got to be good). An entire generation of sexually expressive sluts will be convinced that if they don't use Trojan Black Ribbed Nobblers (Now with Microdots!&#153;) they'll be sure to catch the preggers.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images3/1.4.gif"><br>   <dd>   Is the mere idea of corporate contributions offensive to you? RIT and other universities have been cashing in on this idea for years. Kodak, Xerox, Microsoft, the CIA...they all give money and materials to colleges that pander to their interests. Why shouldn't the preparatory schools jump on the bandwagon? Think about it: a captive audience of intellectually and morally malleable people guaranteed to be in any of the demographics between the ages of five and eighteen. Advertisers would pay through the nose<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#167;</A></a> for a spot like that. It would guarantee each school system millions of dollars above what they already receive.  Forget the gaudy surroundings and the totally immoral use of school children. Just remember that your children, and all of the other children, would be receiving the best education that money could buy.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> The entire movement to abolish corporal punishment was waged by the little known Pink Panthers.
