I've been given a space to rant by the Supreme Exalted Biumvirate, so I've chosen a topic near and dear to my heart (and, by extension, the inside of my ribs):  Music.  First off, let me say that "Squirrel Nut Zippers" is a GREAT name for a band.  It sounds like the band members got drunk one night and played the word association game until they hit upon the best three word group.  Try it with your friends!  Secondly, as a music major, it depresses and frustrates me to know that the average life span of a jazz musician is equal to that of a serf in twelfth century England, and that in the time it took you to read this sentence John Tesh made more money than the entire Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra did last season. So I've got a few things to get off my chest.<br>    <dd>  Since we're speaking of chests, I hope everyone realizes by now that the Spice Girls are a joke.   J. S. Bach's music has remained relevant for over 200 years, but 200 days from now people will be talking of the Spice Girls with the same kind of respect and admiration normally reserved for Milli Vanilli and the Macarena.  And they may mention the Spice Girls and Milli Vanilli together for more than just that...because if these prepackaged fluffballs are singing their own songs, then I'm willing to be Pavoratti's next mistress.<br>   <dd>   Quite frankly, I have never understood the I-have-no-accent-when-I-sing phenomenon, made famous by Olivia Newton-John in "Grease," but these Girls are extreme.  Singing, they sound like diction coaches.  In interviews, all I can hear is, "Freshen ya' drink, guv'nah?"<br>  <dd>   Speaking of the Decline and Fall of Vocal Diction, one of the summer's big smash hits was "Mmm Bop", by Hanson.  If you're not familiar, Hanson is a prank band comprised of three life-like Muppets put together by Henson Enterprises in an effort to reclaim the prestige and money it lost after the new, revamped Muppet Show bombed.  "Mmm Bop," if you're not familiar, is a song featuring no actual words, and was perhaps inspired by an informal conversation Frank Oz had with a drunk on the subway.  I imagine it went something like this:<br>    <dD>  <B>Drunk:</B> Ahma jus widdle flinkin goda nohn. Maka ham ida plinky mista goes<br>  <dd>   <B>Frank Oz:</B> Mmmm...<br>  <dd>   (Subway train hitting a bump): BOP!<br>  <dd>   This freedom from the heavy burden of lyrics (although the New York Transit Authority got a writing credit, which I thought was a nice gesture) allowed the Henson crew to focus their energies into the demanding and delicate task of rehashing the same song nine or ten times to make an album.  Which they succeeded at admirably...if you've heard the second single off the record.  Now, to be fair, some classical composers made whole careers out of rehashing the same stuff.  The standard joke in music school is that Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741, Italian composer of the Baroque era) didn't write 500 concertos; he wrote the same concerto 500 times.  But at least he kept writing a great piece of music again and again, one that has stood the test of time until this very day, to be ripped off by the DeBeers people in their damn "You just finished paying off the ring, time for the necklace!" commercials.<br>  <dd>   Next time, some bitching about the unspoken vocal diction double standard that exists in American music, as well as a frank and earnest discussion of my favorite type of Diction Impairment, Jamaican reggae rap.  <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/newgrove.html">Other New Groves in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
