The angelic man who is Mike has strained, pushed and perused with me all day.  My new apartment is now half full of furniture and we've enjoyed the couch futon for our post-grunting pints of Guinness (when your friends help you garage sale ALL DAY, you should always buy the most expensive beer on the shelf for a kind compensation).<br>  <dd>    Now a misty fog has dropped over Mt. Hope, and we've taken to wandering melancholy through the necropolis in our post three pint daze.  Frederick Douglas remains elusive (where the *@%! did they bury that crotchety old revolutionary?), and the heavy dew has turned our brown leather clods into soppy, mobile puddles.  Without any reasonable idea of navigation we come to the rise of a small hill that overlooks a choked valley filled with ancient stones.<br>  <dd>    "Let's throw my garage sale baseball..." chuckles Mike.<br>    <dd>  Somewhere in whatever heaven is, Buddha rubs his belly and giggles, pointing out the sheer Zen Lunacy of the idea to a pathetically pale old man who's temples bleed incessantly.  The old man digs a tiny riding crop out of his blonde beard and begins the slow, monotonous task of lashing himself mercilessly to forgive the universe for the sins of young men who would be so foolish as to play baseball in a cemetery.<br>   <dd>   Guinness not being famously conducive to sports activity, the missed balls lead us deeper into the groves of old stones; Mike always chuckling and me rubbing the drizzle off my skull.  A long overthrown toss leads us round a sharp corner in one of the roads to find a small red car that gently rocks in a soothing, organic tempo.<br>   <dd>   Rounding the far side of the car we hear a giggle then see a girl.  Really, a real grrrrrrl, one to make the boys whimper and coo, the kind of girl that haunts the waking minutes spent under warm covers contemplating dawn.  She's scrambling into a dress, but we're flashed the garters, stockings, and lacy things.  Mike is catatonic until I yank the Nikon off his neck, but it's too late and she's scrabbling to her feet, grinning.<br>   <dd>   She stands there for a moment, looking at the camera, thinking she's been photographed while trying to get into her dress.  A low, animal purr, and she cocks her hips.<br>    <dd>   "Niiiiiiice."<br>  <dd>   Mike and I spent the rest of our afternoon bouncing our baseball off the granite tits of cemetery angels.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/americana.html"> Other Americana Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/chrisl.html">Christopher Lane</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
