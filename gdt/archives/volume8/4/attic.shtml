But I didn't really have to move my car, I parked in the driveway. I had to go to work early. So I had to make sure my car was on the street, because I didn't want to get parked in. You know, because no one really wants to be woken up at five in the morning to move their car if I could have moved my car, like, last night.<br> <dd>    So I went to move my car, and there I see Priscilla Cat of Trailer (proper name) at the door. So I'm like, "Wow, she wants to go outside." So I said, "Trailer Cat" - Trailer Cat for short. Priscilla Cat, Queen of the Trailer is a lot to say all of the time. So we go out to move the car. She's all excited because you know we're going outside. She never gets to go outside. She's an indoor cat. Hence, you know, not...going...outside (Come on people. Keep up with me here). So, okay, we get in the car and she's a little nervous. She's only been in her cat carrier with side kick Arnold. But I turn on the car, she's looking out the window, and her tail is a little poofed. That's not that bad. Reversing-she's in control, She's not under the brake pedals, or any other pedals. There are three of them-if you're wondering. And okay, we're in the car, whatever, whatever. Tchoo, tchoo tchoo. Okay we get to the parking spot, and everything is good. But you know, the car has a short, so I have to disconnect the battery before I turn it off so I don't have the lights staying on. So that's a big problem.<br>   <dd>  So I have to leave her in the car. And she thinks I'm leaving her behind, she's like, "Merow(Impatient).  Don't leave me." And she's all upset, because I have to like close the door and she's in the car, and I'm not in the car. And we're not in the house. This is very unfamiliar to her. So I'm out there disconnecting the battery, and then I decide it needs a little oil. Because as usual we're (royal we) low on oil. So I'm putting some oil in. And she's at the window meowing. And these kids across the street are like, "Wow, look there's a cat. She's leaving her in the car." I'm like, "No I'm not leaving her in the car, I have to check the oil."<br>  <dd>   And they're like, "Oh, she's fat. Wow, look at that fat cat." And I'm like, "It's not a fat cat, she's big boned." They didn't actually call her fat, they said she was big. But I knew what they meant. She sort of has a big belly. So...you know, then I picked her up and we went back inside. And she wasn't very happy, she was like all squiggly, ready to get to the ground. But I couldn't put her down because it was outside. And then we went inside and she was all happy. And, umm, now she doesn't want to go outside anymore.<br>   <dD>  And I'm thinking outside would have been a good experience, you know broaden her horizons, they're very small, she's has three floors plus the Inferno to run around on. That's not such a big amount of territory. But, you know, we'll take little baby steps.<br>   <dd>  So I'm thinking next time maybe we can take Arnold, but he doesn't really like being in the car. Because, you know, when we go to the vet, he's in the cat carrier with Trailer Cat. And he sticks his paw out, then we have to hold paws. And it's really hard to shift when you're holding paws. But he meows if you don't hold paws, because he's all nervous. Because, you know, he was a stray when he was found. And he was on Lyle Avenue and the little kids were shooting bee-bees at him. So he had a big time of adjustment, because Trailer Cat beat the shit out of him for so long. She didn't like him, I didn't think she would be so territorial. It was in this four hundred square foot trailer. You know, she's lonely, she doesn't go anywhere. My neighbors live in each and she doesn't go anywhere else. So, you know, he had this rough adjustment period. He just sat on my trail...tra.. trail...er's hard to say. I'm talking to myself here.<br>  <dd>    So he sat in my chair, and he didn't move. He didn't play, he didn't eat, he didn't clean himself. She slept in the cat box, so he couldn't use the cat box. That's pretty territorial. I was very worried, then one day they started to play. Which was lucky, because I was about to give him away the next day. So, I'm thinking that, you know, the car ride would be really traumatic for him. He's a wuss. He's very non-confrontational. He doesn't even fight with Alley. She hisses at him, he runs away. Alley is another cat. Not a person. `nuther story.<br>   <dd>  So, you know, the car ride probably wouldn't be so good for Arnold. But he might enjoy it, you might see a new side of him. You never know. Yeah, that would be good.<br><IMG  width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images4/attic.gif"><br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
