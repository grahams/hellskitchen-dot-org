Wisconsin-where else can you find a store called "Cheese and Fireworks?" The two major sources of happiness together under one rooftop. Ahhh, cheese and explosives. What do these seemingly unrelated items have in common? Let the following logical proof illustrate:<p><dd>	<I>1. Some cheese comes from goats<br><dd>	2. Some goats explode<br><dd><hr width = 100><br><dd>	therefore some cheese is explosive</I><p>  <dd>   OK. So now we all know why I got a C in logic. Maybe the connection is known only to Wisconsin locals. Maybe it's a mystery, kind of like the cornbread at ChiChi's. I think some questions can never be answered, like why New Jersey has five area codes and why I keep having that nightmare about Dean Burgett hitting my head with a bright yellow frisbee. The answer to all of these questions (along with the mystery of cheese) probably lies somewhere in the bowels of Wisconsin. I'm afraid that I can't contribute to this blossoming field of knowledge because a two hour stop in Madison doesn't qualify as a significant sample of participant-observation research. In fact, the more I think about it, forget midget colonies. I think I smell doctorate theses!<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top><center><IMG   SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images4/cheese.gif"><br><B>One of the many randomly placed roadside "Cheese" signs.</center></B></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/ma.html">Michelle Amoruso</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
