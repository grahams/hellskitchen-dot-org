<html><TITLE>Correction </TITLE><P><body bgcolor=FFFFFF><A NAME="correction"><body><table border width = 300><tr><td valign = top align = center><B>Corrections:</B><br>  <dd>   Sometimes we don't do enough research for our articles and we make a mistake. In <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/2/main.shtml">Volume 8, issue 2</A>, we printed, "...what would the Kurds do if Turkey and Iran were to grant them independence...besides be land locked and have no exports." A critic was quick to point out that the Kurds are not landlocked. Well, he's absolutely correct! Using the maxim "The Kurds end where the mountains end," the area of what could loosely be called Kurdistan has a stretch of approximately 20 miles of ocean view property sitting on the Mediterranean.<br> <dd>    We encourage all our readers and critics to be quick and point out errors that we make in our facts. Please refrain from commenting on grammar and spelling: we are already aware of those problems. If we print something incorrect out of ignorance, we're not above admitting it.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/4/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
