Remember, you're in a cave on Mars listening to "Smells Like Teen Spirit"), I'm sure you're aware that China has regained control of Hong Kong.<br>   <dd>   To the British, the loss of Hong Kong officially ends their Dominion. No longer can it be said that the sun never sets on the British Empire.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> Quite to the contrary, England has been forced to purchase a night light. Even on its own little island-Kingdom the disintegration continues as the Scots, Welsh, the two literate blokes in Sussex, and of course the Irish, bicker and rail against the Monarchy<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a> fast making  the United Kingdom an oxymoron. <br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images4/1.1.gif"><br><dd>   Meanwhile, their royal Highnesses are busy sleeping around, causing scandals, and otherwise cracking a smile as often as Jesus changed his knappy. Any respectability left in the British Royalty's gene pool buggered off with Edward VIII when he abdicated the throne for love of a commoner. How can that compare to the pompous wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana? Even the writers of "Airwolf" knew that divorce was imminent.<br>    <dd>  Back to the point, such as it is.<br>   <dd>       While Imperialism wanes among European powers and their cowboy cousins across the pond, the national equivalents of Johnny Come-Latelies are picking up where their old overlords left off.  Hell, even the Evil Empire of Ayn Rand's goldenboy (God, wouldn't I like to smack her) has gone the way of tinkle-down economics and reverted back to its numerous separate countries...most of whom are more interested in fighting with themselves than anything else.<br>  <dd>    China, behind the times for the past few centuries due to the convoluted nature in which their original incense clocks<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#131;</A></a> mapped to Greenwich Mean Time (the poor yellow bastards inadvertently misplaced a few centuries and dropped the ball with explosives. <I>Now</I> imperialism's cool? As if! That's so last century! This century everything is internal turmoil. God! Get with the program. What's the next thing they're going to completely ignore until it's day is past, jams and grunge?), is just now reaching its stride and finding out how much fun it can be to overrun neighbors and forge an empire on the wormy bodies of their dead children.<br><IMG  width = 300 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images4/1.2.gif"><br><dd>    Go China!<br> <dd>    Now that North Korea is starving itself to death and planning on a massive nuclear strike against the South in an attitude of, "Yeah, I'm dying...but I'm feeling rather peckish today," China can really come into its own as the last bastion of sweatshops, pantsuits and down to earth hard-core Communist dogma. Where the United States of America, and MCC, have the Monroe Doctrine to justify their annexation of all the land they could get their grubby little mitts on from sea to oily sea, the Communists have the philosophy of Marx, Engels, and Mao guiding them...but since all these buggers are silly foreigners,<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> no one listens to them anyway. Still, given the inevitable proletariat revolution that will sweep across the globe any day now, its only logical for China to be interested in regaining territory that either was or (they believed) should have been theirs.<br>  <dd>    Typically chalked up to xenophobia and general bullyship, what isn't taken into account when examining China's foreign policies is the notoriousness of the Communists for their five year plans. Unlike most human organizations (with the exception of Secret Societies, which have the unnerving tendancy to think in terms of centuries when planning. The bastards are like Asimov's Second Foundation) that are interested only in a quarter's profits or current opinion polls, the Communists have shown their mettle in planning for the future. In one shining example of Soviet ingenuity under Stalin, the bread lines were perfected in a scant half decade. In a close second for planning is Pol Pot: now there was a mass murderer with vision.<br>  <dd>    When the Chinese Army liberated Tibet from itself on 7 October 1950 AD, they were planning something so grand it dumfounds the imagination. Their recent reacquisition of Hong Kong and their saber rattling over the Diaoyutai Islands  (covered at high tide and, incidentally, the first region to produce wet-look-knit-wear) are simply continuations of their plan.<br><dd>    You see, on the eve of the Communist victory against the Guomindang and the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong had a vision.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#135;</A></a> Well educated and well read in the emerging genera of speculative fiction from the decadent Capitalist countries, Mao could foresee a time, far after his death, when the Chinese would be among the stars in tight spandex minis. With this vision to guide him, years before the CCCP and the USA began their race to put primates in orbit, the People's Republic of China began its long range plans to send its people to the stars.<br><center><I>&#60;star trek fight music&#62;</I><br></center> <dd>  Their first step was the annexation of Tibet. Though this seems useless, remember the underlying problem with space travel: long distances. In the absence of being able to travel very fast, tesser, or have enough in-flight movies to last for centuries...or at least enough movie theatre popcorn, the Chinese opted for recruiting from the few people who could survive the trips without the popcorn.<br><center><I>&#60;/star trek fight music&#62;</I><br></center> <IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images4/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    World renowned for their ability to induce death-like meditative states where their metabolism slows to a crawl, Tibetan Yogis now form the core of the Chinese space program. The Dali Lama, on the lamb, has attempted to organize an American training school at NASA as part of America's deterrence policy, but potential American Yogi's tend to bomb out after reaching Zen 101.<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>    To provide an excuse for sending Chinese to the heavens, the Chinese government began a program to raise the population beyond all logical limits. Today, there are over a billion Chinese; quite a sizable population to draw potential colonization fleets from....<br>   <dd>  Knowing that Hong Kong under the British would become a technological island, China bided its time. With its return, coupled with its massive computer software pirating business on the mainland, China's ready to take its place as the national version of Microsoft.<br>   <dd>  With its juggernaut program fully operational and its technological abilities secured, China has been concerned with its capsule recovery program. With the aforementioned population mega-explosion, there is little space for extensive landing sites. Unwilling to copy the Soviet recipe for cosmonaut pate, and rejecting the Rube Goldberg technology of NASA, the Chinese plan on taking possession of the Diaoyutai Islands and having splashdowns reminiscent of NASA's Mercury Spam-in-a-can&#153; program.<br>   <dd>   In the next ten years China will have secured all the land and resources necessary to begin sending its people into space. And with a surplus like they have, its no big feat to imagine they won't be too worried about losses. Their attempt to find Alice Cramdon on Luna failed? Well, send up a new batch to try again. Kill all you want, we'll make more.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> Actually, the British "Empire" is still open 24-7 but they've lost a good chunk of their electronic and Thai food departments. Between the transiently inhabited islands in the Indian Ocean and the 56 folks on the Pitcairn Islands (shall I name them all?), there is a 24 hour glow from the bright burning incandescent ball in the sky. Even in their darkest hour (ironically, on the longest day for Mother England), June 21, there's still about a half hour when those little colonies share the sun.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164;</A> It looks sort of like Parliament on a rowdy day, except with scones and bad teeth...which Parliament also has.<BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#131;</A> Invented in 1073 AD, the incense clock tied in nicely to the early 20th century Relativity Theories where, in four dimensional space, the burning of the incense works in a linear fashion consistent with the fourth dimension of time, hence allowing complex theories to be developed. More complex, I might add, than you can understand.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#165;</A>  Alternate ending to sentence: "...none of our readers know who the hell they are anyway."<br><A HREF="#5.5">&#135;</A> Nope.

This is an extreme reaction, but is not unheard of in people who have been trained in engineering and mathematics.
