The simple fact is, dear readers, that Sean has always had an extra-special fondness for Prince Charles.  It may be the ears, it may be that he has a permanent manly aura of horse, sweat, and leather about him, but whatever the reason, something shriveled up and turned ash gray inside of Sean on that fateful day when Lady Diana Spenser became the Princess of Wales.  It was a blow he never seemed to get over.  How many countless times have staffers shown up for GDT meetings, only to be greeted by Sean in full royal gown and tiara, insisting in falsetto that "I am the Princess!"?  But the day the fearful world woke up to the news of Diana's death?  Well, down in Whoville they say, Sean's heart grew <I>three</I> sizes that day!<p>    <dd>  Diction, in case you didn't gather from last week, is defined in my <I>Funk & Wagnalls</I> as "enunciation."  So then you have to look up "enunciation," which is defined as "to pronounce words with distinct articulation."  We have already discussed serious transgressions of diction in the form of Hanson last week.  Possibly you said to yourself, "Well, I heard 'Mmm-bop' and I understood the words," in which case I strongly suggest you stick it because you were listening to 98PXY and they only play five songs in rotation all day. If I heard the same damn song at 20 minute intervals I could figure out the words soon enough too, but I'd rather make up my own lyrics and try to rhyme challenging things like "colon."  "Going bowlin'" works well, I've found.<br> 	<dd><I>Some places are bad to have a spastic colon,<br>  <dd>	like at a wake or when you're going bowlin'.<br> 	<dd>Mmm-bop, bop, bop, mmm...</I><br>  <dd>    But what really gets my goat (rhymes with "build a moat") is the terrible double standard in American music today.  Staple FM bands can get away with the language equivalent of manslaughter-Mick Jagger has made a career out of it-but jazz singers who use nonsense syllables in a purposeful, artistic way are scorned like the proverbial leper in the chicken coop.  I'm not sure what proverb that's from, but the point is these people are spontaneously creating melodies on a complex rhythmic and harmonic level, not just slurring their speech to pop formulas.  Yet people hate people who scat sing.  My dad, for example, detests scat singing.  As far as he's concerned, the singer should sing the melody and then GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY! Enough of this "bee-dop-a-zwee-zwee-zwee" horseshit.  He also will listen to a polka station until <I>and after</I> the signal degrades so badly that only cosmic background radiation is audible, so maybe he's a bad example.  But ordinary people can't get away with it either.  I scat sing in the car, and my girlfriend turns on the radio.  Loud.  To 98PXY.  Editor #1 scat sings and becomes subject to Evil Death Glares from Editor #2.  And just forget about it on the bus.  I think this phenomenon goes past scat singing, though.  People hate people who scat sing because the singers radiate a bubbly, carefree happiness, and people hate that.<br>   <dd>   "What are you so carefree about, damnit?" they say.  "Why don't you listen to a Cure album?"<br>  <dd>   I do have a certain fondness for one type of diction impairment, however.  Like the esquilax, Jamaican reggae rap is wonderful because it is so blatant as to be ridiculous.  My only experience with this form comes from being stopped next to Souped-Up Radio Cars at red lights.  You know, the cars where the back speakers have been replaced by actual Marshall stacks?  During the summer these concerts on wheels assault us with music featuring a steady, undulating reggae beat and a rapper who is extremely careful to articulate the last word of a line and equally careful to render all the other words unintelligible.  The results can only be approximated in print: <br><font size = +1><center><B>Hahbah gotty itcha baygee toobee toobee <U>car</U>,<br>Raja hama flingy ippy yada mak <U>too far</U>. </B><br></center></font size><dd>   Jump up and down as you scream the lyrics and you get the general idea.  Try it on the bus!<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/newgrove.html">Other New Groves in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
