Hey, I could go there." You know, that's where you're supposed to pay your taxes. And when do you pay your taxes, March, April? I don't know. I don't know  because I haven't paid them.<br>   <dd>   So okay. That was a while ago, but you know they're just taxes. So who really cares? So, like I'm gonna tell them why I haven't paid my taxes. But I'm not trying to hide it; obviously I'm telling you.<br>  <dd>    But okay. So I owe them four hundred dollars. That's a lot of money. Well, the IRS probably doesn't think it's a lot of money. But um, I didn't pay and it's really not my fault because you see I was working for this company that kind of went bankrupt. But they didn't declare bankruptcy. So they weren't in bankruptcy court so I couldn't  make them give me a W-2. But they didn't pay. They didn't pay me once, because they were being sued. Their accounts were frozen and they were being sued because they told they were going to be sued. So their accounts got frozen, so I didn't get a paycheck, so I had no money, so I had to quit. Winter comes around, and it was like February or whatever the hell it was, and they, like, don't send me a W-2 and I'm like, "Oh, whatever."<br>  <dd>   So I call the IRS and I'm like, "I didn't keep any paystubs." Like who keeps paystubs? What a waste of paperwork. And, um, they didn't declare bankruptcy so the IRS is like, "Yeah, whatever. We can't help you. So make up your income." So I make up my income.<br>   <dd>   I estimate my taxes and, of course, my father does my taxes. So I'm like, "I'm, like, here Padre. Do my taxes. Make up my income, make up my taxes, whatever, whatever, whatever." And, ah, he does it. And he writes an essay explaining it because he's responsible so you know I don't get in trouble. And so the IRS sends me some money back, because you know maybe I misestimated my income. Or something like that. Not that I would do that on purpose.<br>    <dd>  That was fine and dandy and I got the check in the mail. And like the day before the company I was working for sent me a W-2. And I'm like, "Ohh, this isn't what I said originally." But the figure was wrong. Since I had no pay stubs, how the hell was I supposed to know if it's right or wrong. So I called my father and I'm like, "Hey, Padre. I got the W-2." He's like, "Oh?" So we had to revise my tax thing. And I told him not to send me the IRS check. I said, "If you send me the check, I'm gonna cash it." Course if you see lots of money in front of you you're gonna go cash it. I needed to do things.<br>  <dd>    But he sent me the check anyway. So I cashed it like I told him. He does the new W-2. It turns out I owe them four hundred dollars. I only owed them fifty but they'd already sent me a check for three-fifty. If you could do the math as well as I could you could see how I owe them four hundred dollars. Yeah, Padre sent me this new taxform or whatever the hell it was. And he said, "Okay, pay them. So now you pay them, whatever, whatever." I said, "I don't have it. I spent it." He's like, "Ohhh." So then I had this thing sitting around for a while-the form-and then I think I lost it.<br>   <dd>   But if I tell the IRS, I'm sure they'll be okay with it. Hey, I'll pay this sooner or later-which I will-it's just not a priority. I'm like hello. You know, I went shopping. I don't need to pay the IRS. Um, anyway my father thinks he has to bail me out of jail if they ever catch me, but it takes a long time. And I'm pretty young so I could probably talk my way out of it and be like, "Oh, my father told me I could pay you later."<br>   <dd>  Blame him, he's always out of town.<br>    <dd>  So I'm thinking, I'll show up, I'll give them this whole long story. And they'll just be like, "Go away! shut up! Stop telling us this story!" and then maybe I won't  have to pay anything at all. If I talk enough. Uhum. So I figure one of you could bail me out of jail then, right?<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table><center><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images5/attic.gif"><br></center>    <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
