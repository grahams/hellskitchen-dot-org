Like so many reasonably intelligent mammals before you, you have neglected to truly read some of our material, which specifically states, "Gracies Dinnertime Theatre reserves the right not to edit for clarity." I'm just practicing my rights. We are not mind readers here. We can not assume the responsibility of translating other people's letters and ideas until we can get them to a closer approximation of what it is the author actually would have wanted to write were they not on a caffeine high, reasonably coherent at the time, or had a relatively good grasp on the english language (or any of the derivations thereof). It would hardly make sense for us to edit other people's letters for clarity when we don't even do that for our own articles. You can see the dilemma we're in. Rather than engross ourselves in some huge double standard, we have decided to take the high road and perpetuate mediocrity. Ah, mediocrity! That grand mysterious machine that packs all our unworthy lives with the forces of ignorance, banality, and forms in triplicate. Where would our world of wonders be without you besides short one Michael the Dark Angel and Dorthy Brown?<br>  <dD>   Now that that tangent is over, you will observe that your question is unedited.<br>  <dd>   Oh yeah, the answer to your question is: no. Besides, if you were truly Sandro Botticelli for a moment, you would already know that although around the time of his birth "Sammy" was quite the popular name for the youngin's of Rome (especially those nubile young lads who spent so much time with the elderly gentlemen at the baths), the name was considered bad form in the rich circles of Florence, and I believe that "Brad" was upon no occasion blessed with a deluge of proud Italian parents, all bursting open with enthusiasm to call their poor male children by such a name. At any rate, you were the one who spent a moment in the life of Botticelli, so you obviously already know the answer to this question, and you're just wasting my time.
