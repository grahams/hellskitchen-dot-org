The main article of two weeks ago <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/3/main.shtml">(Volume 8, issue 3)</A>, dealing with the commercialization of public education in order to raise money, is now a reality in eight states. According to this October's <I>Consumer Reports</I>, several states have passed laws allowing advertisers space on the sides and rear of their local school buses. The rest of what our article wrote about is a few years away at most, but I can't wait until they carry the madness all the way to advertising on school uniforms. This is what our children were really meant to be; walking billboards.<br>  <dd>   On a more personal note, I would just like to make an editor's clarification about last week's "New Grove" column. A widely-debated scat issue arose during said article. In this article, scat was described as "&hellip;spontaneously creating melodies on a complex rhythmic and harmonic level&hellip;." It then went on to describe the Evil Death Glare&153; that editor number two lavishes upon editor number one upon the occasion of editor number one's performance of said act. This obvious display of jaundiced writing insinuates quite clearly that editor number one is in fact capable of such an artistically valid rendering of the art of scatting. This insinuation, although a quaint bit of fiction, completely ignores the fact that editor number one is about as tone deaf as can be conceived of. Last week editor number one, under the influences of Evil Death Glares 2.0, had to concede that he had as much chance of producing intricately harmonious and complex melodies as Bob Dylan is when dealing with a screaming case of laryngitis.<br>   <dd>   At this point it should be further noted that editor number one turned turncoat and ran, offering up the phrase, "Well yeah, but you should hear Mark scat." With his statement now taken into the record, he has been allowed to reacquaint himself with the toils of every day life.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
