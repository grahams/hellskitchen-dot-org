I sat at the table, kicking my seven year old legs under my chair. They weren't long enough to reach the floor yet. It was just me and my baby-sitter for lunch that day. Her kids were out somewhere. I no longer remember where and it does not matter.<br>   <dd>   The baby-sitter brought me my lunch that my Mother had packed for me that morning before bringing me over to the sitter's. It was Summer and school was out. I don't remember exactly what was in the brown bag. Probably a sandwich inside a Tupperware container and a snack of some sort. Over all, it does not matter anyhow.<br>    <dd>  This woman, this baby-sitter, entrusted with my safe-keeping, continued to stand over me. After a pregnant pause, she asked me," Tommy, do you believe in God?".<br>  <dd>   I looked down at my lunch sitting in it's bag and out of the corner of my eye, saw her standing beside me, waiting for an answer.<br>   <dd>   "No.", I told her, but directed it at my unopened lunch. Her daughter, Kim, must have snitched to her that I had said that I didn't believe.<br>   <dd>   I never really had believed as long as I could remember. Even when I believed that Tinkerbell from Peter Pan lived in the hole inside my refrigerator. You know that one at the bottom of the fridge that they put the plug into? I would pull out the plug and talk down into the hole. I had been four or five at the time and even then, Tinkerbell in my fridge had been easier to swallow than God up in Heaven.<br>   <dd>  "Why not?", She asked.<br>  <dd>   I continued to stare at my lunch and just shrugged my shoulders. I had reasons, but I didn't want to explain. I could tell it was pointless already.<br>   <dd>  "You should believe. If you die, you want to go to heaven. Don't you?", She asked me another question that made me want to crawl under the table.<br>   <dd>   I nodded after a pause. It was easier. Besides, I could want to go there, it still didn't mean I believed in it though.<br>  <dd>    "Good. Then you have to do what I say. Okay?", she came down to smile at my face level. My body was numb but I could feel my head nod assent.<br>  <dd>   She led me through "The Lord's Prayer" and some other Born Again Christian crap. Forcing it down my throat like Ipecac and making me vomit the words back to her. The words were hollow and meaningless.<br>   <dd>   When it was done, she congratulated me on being born again and left me to eat the food that I no longer had an appetite for, not after having God's cock shoved down my throat.<br>   <dd>  A few years later I would have a repeat experience with another baby-sitter. She was the wife of a Baptist minister. I was ten at the time and more argumentative. She resorted to threats of Hell and being on fire forever. I had to lay still and take it again.<br>   <dd>  The same year, my great-grandmother came to live with us. She took over baby-sitting duties. She was a Mormon, and once again I was in danger of hell. Once again, I had to fake my conversion.<br>  <dd>   This had the affect of making me violently opposed to Christianity as I grew up. This is no longer the case. I am still agnostic with atheist leanings, but I no longer spout my beliefs in the faces of those around me. I've begun to see that not all Christians are bullies waiting to spiritually beat you up and take your choices, like extorted lunch money.<br> <dd>   On the news I watch as various groups attempt to ban whatever "evil" rock band is popular at the moment. Citing that the band will cause kids to turn away from God. I think that a good number of the people in moral groups like these are doing a fine job of turning kids off on religion without help.<br>   <dd>  Also in a day and age when parent groups are concerned what their kids will be exposed to on the internet, I wonder if they put much thought into what their kids are exposed to when they drop them off at a friend's, relative's or even some stranger's house. Not all molestation is physical.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/tg.html">T.
