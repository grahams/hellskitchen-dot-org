We're at the meeting, and we're talking about Andres. We're talking about how Sean said, "On dray." And I mentioned this guy, Andre, he's from...ahh....where in the hell? He's from, um, Belgium! But they said, "Andre, like do you know Andre?"<br>  <dd>   And I was like, "Oh my God! I lost a point on my highschool French test because I said that Andre was female." And my teacher is like, "Nooo, Andre is only a male name." I'm like, "No, no, no. I have this aunt whose best friend is Andre." And Andre is, like, this woman, and obviously because I said <I>elle</I> instead of <I>il</I>. And I know she's female, because my aunt talked about her.<br>  <dd>    There was this wedding. My aunt got married to some guy from Geneva, so they at once flew to France and then they had to take another plane up, and then a train. The problem was that they tried to make reservations for first class but they got stuck in second class, because apparently second class is like a sty, and my grandparents are like, "Oh, you're not staying here." And Andre went and they're like, "Oh, Andre speaks fluent French," because she lives in Paris, and she talked their way into first class. Their like, you know, "We may sleep here, but we will not spend our time here." And they were so impressed because she spoke beautiful French  (spoken in faux French accent).<br>    <dd>  And so, ah, it was a female, and I knew this. And I'm like, "But Andre is a female name. I have this one answer, so why are you taking a point off?" But she wouldn't give me the point back when I explained my reasoning. It was not that I misunderstood the sentence structure of the French question, it was that she didn't understand the name structure of the people I knew. So is that like the stupidest thing in French class? I would have given myself a point. If I was the teacher. But if I was the teacher, I probably wouldn't have been in the class then.<br>     <dd> The subject was kind of goofy anyways because we had it in this little room where we also had math class in the morning. And we had a TA from the university teaching math because the regular math teacher had a heart attack. But he wasn't my math teacher, I was in this other math class. And there were like twenty-five people in there and I was like "Wow, this class is way too big." And there were all these stupid people in it, and they were like, "Okay, stupid people stay here with this new teacher. Those who can do mathematics go to the other class."<br>  <dd>   The teacher they were supposed to use had a heart attack, so he wasn't there. So then we were in this class and they had this TA teaching and every day he would come in and be like, "Do you guys want to do math today?" And we're, like, "No." So we'd go out and get breakfast, which was cool. We had breakfast, that was math. And our midterm and our final was the exact same test.<br>    <dd>  One day he wasn't there and this high school coordinator woman had to teach us. We came in, we're sitting on the desks, we didn't sit in the chairs, we don't have books, and she's like, "You guys aren't bringing books to class?" But we couldn't say, "No. We don't do math," because then we'd have to do math because you're supposed to do math in math class in high school. And we're like, "No. He just does demonstrations on the board."<br>   <dd>  She gave us all these problems and we couldn't do them, cause, ya know, you're supposed to do math. Um. And. We had to cover. It was fun. That was a good math teacher who...didn't teach us.<br>   <dd>   But in the same room, cause it was a really small school with all these multi-purpose use rooms, we had French class. And um, she made us speak french, and the books were in french. My god. And for the record Andre can be either <I>elle</I> or <I>il</I>.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
