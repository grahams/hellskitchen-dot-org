That may or may not be the case, but I do try and read every one. This latest issue (3 October, 1997) wasn't too bad. The cover was really fun and immediately caught my attention. Since we did our "After the Rapture" article last year, the end of the world (or the elimination of devout Christians, whichever comes first) has been a subject of preoccupation for me.  Reporter's cover, showing frenzied crowds celebrating the appearance of a very seriously Borgified Stay Puff Marshmallow Man was both striking and familiar looking. After a moment I realized that it was done by our illustrator.<br><dD>   Huh. No wonder I liked it.<br>   <dd>   The content was passable: a few articles that made me yawn, one that made me squint to read it. There was another that made reference to a pamphlet we have in our morgue: "Never Receive 666-the mark of the beast." One of the personally funniest articles was one that made reference to a "platinum-blond bombshell." That bombshell, dear friends has seen this editor in only a grass skirt and a coconut bra; she was the best friend of my counterpart Kelly Gunter when they were in kiddy-school together...and though she has a great body, the girl should be forced to wear a bag over her head.<br>   <dd>   And you can quote me.<br>   <dD>   Anyway, I got to the back cover, interested to see who was dishing out a couple hundred dollars to place an ad that week, and stared for a long time. In the center of the page was a CIA interest form.<br> <dd>    "Holy shit."<br>  <dd>   After a few moments of dead blackness in my mind I noticed that the ad was slightly crooked and looked a little cut-n-pasty, as though it were in a typical 'zine (more on 'zines in a later issue). With a sigh of relief I concluded that the new and improved <I>Reporter</I> staff (now with static guard) was amazing: with their main article dealing with Ragnarok and the CIA's reputation for murder, mayhem, and general rowdiness, it was a genius stroke to put an interest form for the CIA on the back. Smiling, I set the issue down and started to read <I>The Never Ending Story</I>, but couldn't concentrate. Unable to stand it, finally I got up and called the office of <I>Reporter Magazine</I>. After a moment of speaking with one of the staff, I was told in a why-are-you-asking-me-a-stupid-question voice that the interest form was not a joke; that the CIA paid for the spot. Immediately the blackness I had initially felt returned.<br><dd>   In 1991 RIT was ready to crucify then RIT President Rose over a scandal involving him taking a leave of absence during the Gulf War to work with the CIA. Subsequent investigations of, and cover-ups by, the Rose administration eventually led to his resignation. Now, don't think I'm naive;  I know the CIA pumps hundreds of thousands of dollars into RIT each year. As far back as 1985, RIT and the Agency had reached a deal detailed in a "Memorandum of Agreement." It stated in no uncertain terms that the Agency "recognize[s] RIT as a strategic national resource worthy of explicit development and support." In return for the CIA's funding of specific research projects and support of particular faculty chairs, RIT agreed to tailor its curriculum to be "responsive to certain defined specialties of the CIA." It's not surprising that the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences is CIA'S.<br>   <dd>  As the years have passed and the memory of the campus has lessened, the current administration has continued to implement the plan outlined in the "Memorandum of Agreement." The sacking of top notch, though Agency unfriendly, programs at RIT can been seen as a furthering of the CIA's agenda on the campus by one with just a little inclination toward conspiracy theories.<br>  <dd>   I guess my point to all this is that I'm shocked at <I>Reporter's</I> lack of integrity. The CIA is an organization that brazenly admits to plotting the assassination of foreign leaders, engages in mind control experiments, is tied with drug trafficking in and out of the United States, and has trained terror squads responsible for civilian murders around the world. I do not have too much problem with their intelligence gathering abilities-I reference their World Fact Book quite often-it is their policies of terror and suppression that frighten me.<br> <dd>   <I>The Reporter's</I> active decision to act as the CIA's spindoctor signals a renewed visibility to CIA recruitment on RIT's campus. And what does this say about <I>Reporter Magazine</I>? I wish I could honestly say that it ultimately came down to money, but it is not that simple. For a student produced, university funded publication to run an ad like this sends a certain signal about the university and the publication. The CIA is an organization based on misinformation, suppression of the press, and ultimately, control. By allowing an ad for the CIA to be run in a publication that is, despite its tendency towards the topical, a news-mag, <I>Reporter</I> has raised a number of journalistic ethics questions-not the least of them being: how free is <I>Reporter Magazine</I> to print material with their spooky sponsors looking on?<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
