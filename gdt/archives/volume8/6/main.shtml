In case you hadn't noticed, it's Native Oppression Day! Break out your bells, whistles and truncheons, friends-it's time to go beat some Indians! Oh, our fact checker just pointed out that it is in fact NOT Native Oppression Day; its Columbus Day. What were we thinking? I guess you should put your truncheons away. But keep those bells and whistles! That swarthy Italian ponce has a special place in our hearts...right next to where we keep Hitler and Jerry Lewis.<br>    <dd>  "Oh, Lady!"<br>  <dd>   But this year, instead of focusing on the fun and zaniness Columbus unleashed on the American continent, we're looking towards that nice little part of the globe Columbus thought he was headed for.<br>  <dd>   First, let's talk about eunuchs.<br> <dd>  Constantinople, the home of European chic for centuries, made Eunuchs all the rage throughout the civilized world. Located on the Bosporus Straights and relying on it's extensive <I>castrati</I> cottage industry, it was the logical center for trade of the ball-less wonders<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> and had the market cornered. Singing in the choirs of Byzantium, the gelded soprano short ones were so popular that several eunuch startup companies attempted to muscle in on the Byzantine monopoly. Quickly out distancing its competators, Roman sweat shops began to produce inferior, yet less expensive, eunuchs. For centuries, the two eunuch platforms battled for supremacy throughout Europe. Ultimately, thanks to massive mismanagement, Constantinople lost their Pope, got overrun by Islamic fundamentalists, and eventually the crash<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> prone Roman eunuchs dominated the continent. Of course there were die hard Byzantine eunuch users singing their praises and ease of use, but the eventual invention of the pipe organ made all eunuchs systems obsolete and left thousands of people out of work and without their testicles. After that property values just went straight to hell. Thank your lucky stars you just get downsized. At least <I>you</I> have your balls!<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images6/1.1.gif"><br><dd>    Speaking of balls, on the other side of the planet (almost) the Chinese used eunuch's correctly: as the brunt of bad jokes and keeping a watch on the oppressed women. Meaning "bedwatcher" in Greek, the eunuch's of the Chinese dynasties attended to the royal women, helping to safeguard the purity of the Emperor's line and insuring chastity when needed.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>   Being so intimately associated with the Emperor and his chicks, the Royal Eunuchs were often appointed to trusted positions (read the previous sentence until it's funny). Depending on the power of the Emperor and how much plum wine he drank, the eunuch's were sometimes the ones actually running the Empire.<br> <dd>    Around 1400, about the same time the rock chewing Vikings<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a>were just forgetting that they got their asses kicked by the Skarellings and then were unceremoniously frozen out of Greenland during Europe's mini-iceage, Yung Lo, first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, was up to megalomaniacal mayhem. Under his rule the capital was moved to Peking, the Forbidden City was built, the Great Wall, previously only a Wall, was made Great, and the mammasans invented benwah balls.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>   Cheng Ho, a eunuch through and through, quickly rose in the Imperial ranks from extremely humble beginnings to become Admiral of the Triple Treasure...also known as the Three Jeweled Eunuch (for obvious reasons).  Consisting of 317 ships and having a collective crew of 37,000, this massive array of ships was the largest assembly of ocean going vessels on the globe at the time.<br>    <dd>  In a series of seven voyages between 1409 and 1433, the Three Jeweled Eunuch traveled from Java to as far as the southern tip of Africa. The dirty maps of Helen of Troy<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#131;</A></a> that the Chinese had at the time contained the Nile, the entire East Coast of Africa, and many southern Mediterranean areas. Porcelain and coins found in Somalia and stately Zanzibar, home of citizen Kane, help prove the Chinese had a bustling pay toilet and commorative plate presence in Africa.<br>  <dd>   Unlike the European states that set out to explore in order to bring back riches and torment the natives (Ow, quit it! Ow, quit It!), the Chinese totally baffled those they encountered. Cheng Ho did not set out to collect treasure, trade, explore, convert, or conquer. The Chinese, uniquely ethnocentric, felt (and still feel) that theirs was the only legitimate Empire. The concept that any foreign, and by definition less civilized, country could offer anything to the Chinese was inconceivable (I do not think that means, what you think it means).<br>   <dd>  It was the hope of the Ming Dynasty that the world would voluntarily pay tribute to China. As the fleet sailed across the seas, it was bursting at the seams with butter filled goodness (gold, frankensense, murh.... You get the idea) which they used to smoother the surrounding barbarians (Mmmm, buttered barbarians). Is it any wonder the Samuri of Calicut laughed in contempt when Vasco da Gama tried to impress them with washbasins, beads, and lumps of sugar?<br>   <dd>  Awed by the size and power, yet strange impotency, of the Chinese fleets, countries fell for the whole thing and started sending tribute back to China. Of course there was still a massive trade deficit, but hey, the Chinese didn't need anything.<br><dd>   It wasn't until 20 September, 1414 that the Chinese received a sign from heaven that they were ABsolutely FABulous. On that day the Somali's arrived at the Court with their tribute: a large creature the Chinese had never seen. Called a <I>girin</I> in the tongue of the Somali, it sounded to the Chinese like their word <I>k'i-lin</I>. According to folklore, the <I>k'i-lin</I> was a creature most similar to the concept of the western unicorn and represented surplus of energy in the universe to create creatures like dragons, <I>k'i-lin</I>, and platypi.<br><dd>    When the Somali finally got around to unwrapping their massive Pier One gift box, there stood a deer bodied, oxen tailed, fleshy horned, herb eating, rhythm walking, bell voiced, 15 foot high <I>k'i-lin</I> with strange luminous spots and hooves that nary tread on living beings-the Manifestation of its divine spirit rose up to Heaven's abode.<br><IMG   align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images6/1.3.gif"><br><dd>  The stupid prats were ape shit over a giraffe! They thought it was the best thing since incense clocks. Follow this logic: even though the giraffe came from a distant land it produced an orgy of self-congratulation in the Chinese court. Remember, the Chinese saw themselves as the center of everything. Sooner or later everyone would recognize that fact and willingly come under Chinese control. Until then, all the other people in the world were simply taking care of the place. Therefore, the giraffe came from China-all be it a distant part of China that didn't know it was China's, but still China.<br> <dd>    Got it?<br><dd>   Meanwhile, the expeditions of the ball-less Wonders<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#164;</A></a> came to an abrupt halt in 1433. Called the Great Withdrawal,<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A></a> several edicts were passed placing strict restrictions on Chinese seafarers. By 1474, the main fleet of 400 warships had dwindled to 140, and by 1500 it was illegal to even own a junk with more than two masts.<br><dd>   After the Europeans stopped freaking out about not being able to see Polaris and were able to make it around the the southern tip of Africa, they brought with them their extensive market research done of the western coasts of the dark continent. Confident in knowledge that their products were top of the line, they came equipped with their finest washbasins, glass beads, and sugar. The people of eastern Africa, however, were used to dealing with the deluge of wealth that the Chinese brought. After a great deal of confering amongst themselves, the Europeans did what they always did when reality didn't fit their conception of it: they took their products and Godsized them! By simply adding a little Inquisition, their products became insanely popular. How would you feel if the kids from School District 17 knocked on your door, showed you a basket of severed hands and feet from people who didn't buy their crappy, overpriced candy bars, and then asked you how many you would like? Those Snickers look pretty good all of a sudden.<br>   <dd>   So when you're bitching about Columbus Day and how Columbus and the rest of the European explorers were nothing but pirates and butchers (which they were), take a time out. Be thankful we're not speaking a Chinese dialect and unable to make acronyms. What kind of technical schools would we have without acronyms?<p><table border width =  200><tr><td valign= top><center><B>Make your own Merry Triple Eunuch Columbus Day on the Rocks:</center> <dD>Equal parts Amaretto and Vodka, a splash of ginger ale, two cherries, shaved almonds, all on ice and a slice of orange on the side to help avoid scurvy.
