Sorry about last week, but I simply had to catch up on my episodes of <I>Win Ben Stein's Money</I> (best topic:  "Dr. Kevorkian Unplugged").<br>  <dd>    I don't know what the 70's excuse is, but after a good decade and a half of being dissed by boomers, slackers, hackers, Xers, 49ers, and the International Zionist Conspiracy, retro is back in a big way.  One could argue that the music of the 70's always lived on through the "classic rock" stations, where the likelihood of hearing a Led Zeppelin song every hour is as wacky and outrageous as WKLX playing a Beatles song every hour.  Bands like Foreigner, Journey, Toto, and Kansas owe their current Darien Lake-level of marketability to these stations.  Actually, these bands are comprised of the same four people, which makes double booking a real possibility, but, hey, Ted Nugent isn't doing anything these days.<br>     <dd>   But it was disco that we really loved to hate, and it's disco that's looking hotter than jailbait on prom night now.  Locally, disco is available in the form of  J.T. and the United Booty Foundation or Nik Fever:  The Wrath of Polyester (No, I didn't make these names up, but damnit, I wish I had).  On the national level,  we have been treated,-and by treated I mean assaulted-by remixes of songs from <I>Grease</I> and <I>Saturday Night Fever</I> (Don't think the recent John Travolta cinematic bombardment is any coincidence.  <I>Pulp Fiction</I> my ass).  The BeeGees, and remember this group was <B>the</B> joke band of the 80's, had their own VH1 special, which actual makes me thankful that they have shifted their attention to being the lead horse in the latest Rolling Stones tour chuckwagon.  Also recently appearing on The-Cable-Channel-Where-the-Dead-Walk-the-Earth:  Fleetwood Mac.  As in, "Oh, Fleetwood Mac is back together?  Who the hell asked them to!?"<br>  <dd>    But, as with any truly effective pop culture offensive, music is hardly the only media having flashbacks.  Personally, I first noticed the 70's rehash with the large spate of disaster films Coming To a Theater Near You.  In place of seminal 70's classics such as <I>Earthquake!</I> and <I>The Poseidon Adventure</I> we have  <I>Twister</I>, <I>Volcano</I>, and the movie nobody ever asked to see, <I>Titanic</I>.  In case you've just spent seven years in Tibet, there was much hype, hoopla, and action-figure tie-ins to "anniversary rereleases" of <I>The Godfather</I> and a little film called <I>Star Wars</I>.  Actually, I don't think <I>The Godfather</I> had any merchandising tie-ins; can't see Marlon Brando as a toy (Don Corleone&#153; with Mumbling Action!&#153;  Horse's Head&#153; sold separately).  Currently in theaters the film <I>Boogie Nights</I> celebrates the hedonism of the 70's and the big chill that came with the 80's, correctly, in my estimation, blaming the Reagan administration.  I mean, think about those poor Iranian hostages.  They returned to an America transformed from the one they knew.  I would've hopped the next flight to Tehran just to avoid the culture shock!<br>    <dd>  The small screen (or as I affectionately refer to it, "the opiate of the masses") has caught on to the ratings possibilities of 70's crap as well.  In case there was any doubt in your mind that we're experiencing Countdown to Armageddon, one of the Seven Signs occurred this summer in the form of <I>The Dukes of Hazzard Reunion</I>.  I swear if some network executive gets the brilliant idea of reforming <I>The Love Boat</I> or <I>Fantasy Island</I> from the gelatinous goo from whence they came, I will have <B>no</B> option but to mail them bricks.<br>  <dd>    By now, astute reader, you are obviously thinking to yourself, "With this current mass of 70's regurgitation, former President Richard M. Nixon tragically died a few years too early."  And you would be right, readers!  How astute you are!  Sure, he got the standard state funeral a former First Criminal deserves, but if Nixon had died today, his funeral could have been a wacky, shoot-heroin-through-your-eyeballs, free-for-all blowout!  Request that foreign heads of state show up in platforms and vinyl pants!  A touching tribute as Henry Kissinger sings "Love Will Keep Us Together!"  Special appearance by Leon Jaworski as "The Streaker!"<br>   <dd>   Seriously, the question we must ask ourselves about such tragedies as a 70's revival or the Oklahoma City bombing is, could it happen again?  In 2007, will there be a late 80's revival?  Will Bon Jovi, Warrant, and Poison again contaminate our radio waves?  Will Def Leprous' drummer have only one leg by then?  Can the ozone layer withstand another Big Hair decade?  Folks, I can't take my kid discovering Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and nipple piercing when they go to college.  But I don't think I have to, because I blame <I>Forrest Gump</I>. Without <I>Gump's</I> fuzzy warm look at the 70's, Americans would have been content to keep forgetting these years and keep concentrating on how much healthier "low-fat Twinkies" are for them.<br>     <dd>  So for now, my advice to you is to ride it out.  This too shall pass, although it's passing like a kidney stone.  My only remaining fear is that Bill Clinton, with his pop culture leanings, will start a bloody and pointless war in Southeast Asia any day now.  You know he won't touch Indonesia, but Thailand's been getting pretty cocky lately.  Nothing a little defoliation can't fix, right, Bubba? <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/6/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/newgrove.html">Other New Groves in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
