Here's a couple hundred bucks. Yeah, bye."<br>     <dd> And so, you know, to be cheap I'm flying Pakistani Airlines...which I really don't think should be flying anywhere. So I get on this plane and here I am thinking I'm all cool. I was going to France.  I sure as hell didn't speak any French, though I thought I did. I got an A in French class, not because I knew the difference between Andre and Andre, il and elle, wherever the crap, but I didn't know anyone named Andre when I was getting on the plane, so it didn't matter.<br>   <dd>   So, there were these women who I guess were from Pakistan ('cause it's Pakistani Airlines) dressed up, looking like, you know, proper women in their dresses and the stewardesses are trying to put thousands of people on this damn plane and they're like ,"Eww." And I'm trying to get into my seat and I always like get the extra seats or front seats 'cause, you know, I have long legs so I'm like "Ooh.... Much more comfortable." And I wanted this seat and someone was in it but I had the ticket so it's my seat. And I was yelling at the guy-I wasn't yelling at him, but I'm like, you know, "I think this is my seat," and the woman made me sit somewhere else and I was really annoyed 'cause I wanted the seat. You know, if you request a seat, you have that seat.  Is it so hard to understand why you request a seat?  It's like a reservation: "We can't hold your reservation. If you want to hold your reservation, then, ok, you have to sign and fill this out."  So you know, that's a Seinfeld episode and we really don't need to go there 'cause it's been done. But it's the same concept: my seat was reserved. So I have to sit in this other damn seat. And they have bad food, like "whoa, bad."<br>  <dd>    Ok, but that's not the real problem. The real problem was that the plumbing backed up and everyone would go to the bathroom, and it didn't flush. So, it's like a six hour flight or something, and sometime during that flight you will have to relieve the bladder, or as my friend Tad's mother would say, "eliminate." People on the plane needed to "eliminate," and it stunk. You're like, "Ick, toilets." Especially airline toilets 'cause you know, sewage scented water comes out of them. "Ooh, you have to flush the urine down so it will make it smell worse."<br>   <dd>   So it's like I'm trying to go up to first class 'cause I'm not going in that bathroom, but they won't let me in there-"No no, you stay back there." I'm like, "Oh my god." So I had to go in this bathroom and I really had to go. It's not like I have bladder control. And there's like this mound of toilet paper, it was so high, coming out of the toilet. I don't know how people would use this toilet. It's like trying to like, I don't know, squat at the base of Mount Ranier and hope to hit the top. It does not work. So, there's like this huge mound of old disgusting toilet paper; it's smelling and it was terrible. I think I finally found one that wasn't mounded to that point. I don't remember. I don't care-it was just this mound of toilet paper, and then I had to go through French customs, and I didn't speak French, I had to try and speak and, oh! Paris is so big!<br> <dD>    I was like in a train station, and some guy is like, "Do you need directions?" and I'm like, "Oh. Whatever." I think he was speaking English. So, I have to find a hotel room-okay, and then I got a hotel room. It was really cheap. It was like thirty bucks which isn't bad for Paris, but then I'm like, "Ok, I'm going to cruise around the city; I'm in Paris, I'm sixteen, there's no stopping me." So I go to get on the subway.<br>    <dd>  I'm like, "Yeah I'm getting on the subway." I bought the ticket, whatever. They have these weird tickets, and you know, in New York they have these turnstyles, you know, pretty much you can understand how to get on. But in Paris they have these doors that go like "swoop," and, like, open to the side, so you're trying to go through the doors and they don't open until you stand on a platform. So I put my little ticket in, sa-shoom, the doors don't open. And I'm like, "Oh my god. There's something wrong here." So I try to put my ticket in again. The doors still don't open. And I was so intimidated by the subway doors, not even the doors, the turnstyle doors, that I couldn't get on the subway. That's why I got a thirty dollar hotel room: I couldn't find the youth hostile cause I couldn't get on the subway.<br>    <dd>  Um...that's all. That's the end of my story.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/attic.html"> Other Attic Infernos in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/aw.html">Alex Whitman</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
