In the past decade the basic necessities of life have reasserted themselves in a new world order for many of the impoverished persons of the world. Gone is the era in which food, shelter, and clothing were the most important needs in life. For obvious reasons shelter was put on the back burner some time ago. Food too has gone the way of the Edsel.<BR>  <dD>    Interestingly enough certain other compulsions have stepped up to the plate to fill in where the old ways left off. Communication devices are just one of the new "needs" that have come out of this fundamental change in human existence. It has long been known that true communication is a basic desire for much of the human race, with the exception of many Christian fundamentalists (leave it to the Religious Right to put the "fun" in "mental behavior").<br>   <dd>   Only now it seems that for a growing population of the underprivileged, technologically advanced communication devices are, in some strange bastardized version of the theory of evolution, becoming more necessary for survival. It is not uncommon for those individuals struggling to make ends meet to have a pager, while others who live in the midst of squalor will often carry cell-phones and a good selection of the other devices, sometimes even a decent Internet connection. The most interesting part of this phenomenon is that it seems to be working as some sort of inverse proportion: the less of the old basic needs of humanity you have, the more of the new needs you possess. Often when you pass a group of grubby individuals sleeping out on a vent near a city street, somewhere beneath their moth-eaten old blankets they conceal small US satellites, and others still cradle equipment from the now defunct Star Wars program.<br>   <dd>  The only one of the old needs which hasn't taken a lower seat on the ranking of importance is the need for clothing, but it seems to have changed some as well. Stylish footwear seems to be more important than penicillin, and indeed a good haircut can apparently fill the belly better than most four course meals.<br>  <dD>   I hope this helps.<br>	<dd>-the Bare-foot Girl<br>   </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome/.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
