You sift through the items one by one confident in your telepathic visualization of their contents.<br>   <dd>  Ah, this is new. A very important looking orange envelope that defies all your attempts to determine it's contents. Well, there is nothing for it-you'll simply have to vivisect that puppy. There is a moment of confusion as you sift through the usual form letter formalities:<br><table><tr><td valign = top width = 5></td><td valign = top>D<font size = -1>EAR</font size> O<font size = -1>CCUPANT OF 4</font size> B<font size = -1>LUE</font size> S<font size = -1>PRUCE </font size>L<font size = -1>ANE,</font size><br>   <dd>  W<font size = -1>E REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT ...

You stuff the letter down into the terrycloth lint-ridden abyss of your pocket, and carry on with your usual Saturday afternoon fair (insert calliope music here).<BR>  <DD>    Let me see, crushed ice cubes and V-8.... Did someone turn the volume control up on the refrigerator? The rest of the day passes with a kind of relentless hazy fervor.<BR>   <dd>   Sitting down in front of the television that evening, you run across an interesting story on the TV news. You're only partially interested in the actual content of the article, seeing as you had only changed to this station in the first place to see if you could catch a titillating peek at that cute weather girl who, because of viscous discharge (thankfully unbeknownst to you), does not seem to be doing the weather today.<br>   <dd>  Oh well, might as well listen.<br>  <dd>   The story is strange. It says something about how in the wee hours of the morning, the United States was taken over by the Canadians (<I>Yes, O' Canada</I>). It was a hostile take-over,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#134;</A></a> and since early this morning they've been mobilizing their top executives to downsize the population of our (well technically their) great nation. All useless members of the community (especially Rick Moranis and the newly repatriated Dave Thomas) are being deported.<br> <dd>    You think this must have been some kind of prank phone call, but then you realize you were watching television. You spend the rest of the evening in the usual way, and wake up the following afternoon with the typical hangover. In your misty, bleary-eyed state you look out the window to a fresh, new day and your neighborin<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> being forcibly heaved from her homestead by two smart looking men in expensive power suits. "Wow," you think, "those suits really work. That woman was majorly Dino-sized&#153;." They cram her into a chicken wire crate on the back of a flatbed. Next you see them bustling her husband out, who shelters in his quivering arms their priceless little pooch. You simply must have drank way too much last night and dismiss it as simply another manifestation of your chronic alcohol delusions.<br><dd>  You start about your "morning" routine of donning your robe, quaffing a cup of joe, and vacuuming your cat (for the Belgian waffles of course). You stop in amazement as you glance out the window; the street is swarming with suits-three piece, two piece, executive leisure wear-and they're all attached to some determined looking men and women. Shit! Where is the Neighborhood Watch when you need them (or Adam West for that matter)?<br>   <dD>  You hear noises outside as ladder-scaling executives case your joint to determine your whereabouts. Like any red-blooded American, you hide your sorry ass in the closet until they leave. For the rest of the day you lay low in your abode, almost slipping a couple of times when the phone rings. No, you mustn't answer the phone-the telemarketers are just secret police in cheap suits.<br><dd>  Night falls and you leave the lights off, you're not going to fall for that trick. You sit perched at your window side watching the drama of the night unfold. Various neighbors who had eluded capture all day, make the mistake of traveling to the kitchen to get themselves a late hour snack, the "Got milk?" campaign was working. Door opens and the light goes on-a little signal beacon glistens calling all available executive commandos to it. After some time you realize that the rabble on the street are of a different type than the clean sophisticated power thirsty executives you'd seen all day. These are the executive trainees. Each is outfitted with the basic assertiveness training gear. Wearing night camouflage outfits (with tops for the ladies showing copious amounts of cleavage in classic Canadian video production-style ), and brandishing Biretta M9's filled with glow-in-the-dark paint pellets, they wriggled around on the ground like night-crawlers in an electric Skinner box, with rubber tipped knives in their mouths.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a> Each of them more hungry than the daytime breed-they've got to earn their stripes if their ever going to advance.<br> <IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images7/1.2.gif"><br><dD>    By this time, you're running out of supplies and you've got to leave sometime. There is only one way you can do it-you've got to make them think that you are one of them. You go to your closet to choose your disguise. You've got to find out how many of the boys made it through all right.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A></a> There's not a great deal of selection in your closet and the only thing to do is use that Burlington Coat Factory suit your mom bought you for college interviews.<br><dd>    For the first time in a week you leave the confines of your home. At first, the ploy seems to be working, but suddenly you find yourself surrounded. "Nice try," says the doughy man in charge, "but we can smell a 60/40 cotton-polyester blend from a mile away. Oh, and you should have ironed your slacks." There is nothing left for you but certain deportation.<p>  <br>   Since you are actually reading this right now, I assume this scenario hasn't happened yet. However, it could. At this moment, Lord Thomson and his cronies are buying up American companies like they're on a clearance table at the Dollar General. Before long, those slim foreign quarters you pass off as U.S. currency will be the only thing that <I>will</I> work in a vending machine. We'll be bowing before a maple leaf flag and worshipping the mighty beaver-our purple mountains will yield to the True North, strong and free.<br> </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#167;</A> Reads better once translated into Canadian.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#134;</A>You probably thought it would have been the Japanese who were taking over the country economically, but if you check the list of top investors in this country, the Nips got their asses nudged by the Canadians.
