Send out the missionaries!"  "Can we leave you some literature?  Can we leave you some literature?") when I noticed a competing bumper sticker trend supporting allegiance to either one or the other of the two Christian radio stations in town.  I couldn't help wondering if their devotion to their radio station is as rabid as their devotion to their god ("WGOD, where Jesus isn't just a deity, he's your personal savior").  Do they have to have separate seating at "worship" to divide the radio factions?  Do kids get into fist fights at Sunday School over which radio talk show host has the correct interpretation of John 3:14.<p><dd>Personally I think, like the movie theatres, this market could sustain another Christian radio station.  That way Cerberus would have the correct number of heads ("Yap! Yap! Let us send you some literature!").<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/rae.html">Other Random Acts of E-Mail in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/mn.html">Mark Nowak</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
