Except for one thing. Digital technology has advanced so far in the last two decades: The happy folks at Industrial Light and Magic (they make those big dinosaurs and other things that don't exist, like Arnold Schwarzaneger's acting ability) have the technology to create anything. When Brandon Lee was killed on the set of "The Crow," the special effects crew took an image of his face that was reflected off a mirror, scanned the image, then mapped it onto the face of a stuntman.<br>   <dD>   True story.<br>    <dD>  They can make the impossible possible, and  the unimaginable appear twenty feet above you on the silver screen. So, you can imagine my dismay when I was watching the new and improved Star Wars Trilogy and I was shocked. Sure, they added Jabba to the first movie, extra ice creatures to the second, and crazy muppets dancing sans muppeteers in the third. What about Lando? The one thing they could have done to make the film so much better and they either forgot or dismissed it as silly. Can you imagine how cool "The Empire Strikes Back" would have been if Lando Calrissian (portrayed by Billy Dee Williams) walked around the entire film with a Colt45 tallboy in his hand?<br><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images7/tourist.gif"><br>   <dD>    He greets Han Solo on the landing pad at Cloud City nursing his half empty can, with his bald headed servant holding a chilled six-pack just in case. The whole gang goes inside and there's a kickin' party going on! Then, in "Return of the Jedi", they could have digitally added a forty-ounce to the scenes where he's flying the Millennium Falcon. So when he blew up the second Death Star, he could have poured it all over his head, as well as the head of that crazy lip-faced copilot, to celebrate the victory! All in all, I think the addition would have made the film much more enjoyable for the children who were experiencing the film for the first time. I've written to George Lucas about it.  I have yet to see a response.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
