Originally brought to our attention by a member of RITPlayers, the piece was hung outside the SAU around the same time <I>Reporter Magazine</I> was selling out and running ads for the CIA.<br>   <dd>   No author was listed, making it difficult to locate them. If anyone knows who wrote the piece, please contact us. I have a hunch it was written years ago and posted by someone who packrats things. That doesn't matter. We'd still like to have a name to go with the piece.<br><center><font size = +1><B>Contact GDT via email at gdt@iname.com if you have any information.</B><br></font size></center> <br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
