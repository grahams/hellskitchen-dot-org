Since that time, writers and illustrators have entered our lives for a brief time and eventually faded away. We always remained. In early 1995 Gracies Dinnertime Theatre began as a rant on a single sided sheet with a circulation of sixty issues a week, paid for out of our pockets. In those two and a half years everything has grown: Gracies Dinnertime Theatre is six to eight pages a week, became the progenitor of the Hell's Kitchen group of publications, has directly or indirectly inspired the creation of several new small publishing groups, our circulation is 700 issues a week, and we're read on three Rochester area campuses and in the Greater Rochester area in general.<br>   <dd>  When we approach businesses and groups such as Writers and Books and other local organizations with proposals or pleas for financial support they usually start by saying the equivalent of, "Sch-yah! As if! Get out of my office right now you zine printin', footnote spewin', whitespace hoardin' scissor licking bastard!"&hellip;er I mean&hellip;they say, "No thanks." When they find out we print weekly, they start to take us seriously. Then, when they find out that we've been printing weekly for over two and a half years, they have a tendency to laugh nervously and ask how. Leading members of the RIT staff have expressed amazement that we can somehow continue to write intelligent articles at that quantity on a weekly basis and one professor at the U of R even called us "insanely efficient," something we're immensely proud of.<br>    <dd>   What I want to convey to our readerage is easy for either of us to say, but it must be said. We have got to stop. Presently the two of us are paying close to $50 a week out of our pockets just to keep issues on the U of R, MCC, and in various Rochester locations. We could withdraw back to just RIT and rely on its generous grant, but that path leads to death and is a contradiction of the goals of Hell's Kitchen. For two and a half years we have done the bulk of the writing, layout, editing, creation of front page articles, administrative work, book-keeping, fundraising, handling printing, maintaining the web site, and to a lesser extent, distribution of issues on a weekly basis. Over the breaks we get due to RIT's quarter system, we spend most of our time desperately trying to update our web site (which is now, incidentally, over a year behind the printed edition) and trying to develop new articles for the next quarter. The two of us have spent thousands of hours keeping GDT and Hell's Kitchen alive and thriving despite all the obstacles. However, there is one obstacle we can't seem to overcome: we are both burning out. We both need time to rest and recuperate; time we have not had for two and a half years.<br>     <dD>  So, after our one hundredth issue sometime around March (about the same time that GDT turns three, twenty-one in dog years) we will be going on sabbatical. Our new co-head Jason can not take on the workload by himself; it is too much work for one person to do. It is time for you, our reading public to step up to the plate. We will be leaving for a year, no matter what happens to the publication. If GDT still exists at the end of our year-long break, we will return to it.<br>    <dd>  We are offering to anyone the challenge to maintain a publication that over the course of two years has become entrenched on several college campuses of Rochester. We will not lie to you. The work is hard and time consuming, but if you think you have the dedication we will be glad to show you the ropes. Unless you really want to do this and believe you have the abilities and commitment, do not contact us, we have already wasted enough time responding hopefully to people falsely offering support.<br>    <dd>  If our departure marks the end of GDT, or even Hell's Kitchen, rest assured that we will not go quietly into the night. From what little energy remains in us, we will be pulling out all of the stops. Our last few issues will be some of the best we've ever written, we guarantee it. And if GDT lives on when we leave, it will just be a taste of what's to come.<br> 	<dd>Sincerely from the Head Editors,<br>      	    <table width = 250><tr><td width = 10 valign = top>   </td><td valign = top>        Kelly Gunter and Sean Hammond</td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
