Scandal, shmandal! Who cares if they used a Buddhist temple to help raise money or rolled some modern robber barrens over coffee? Certainly not me. And apparently, not the administration either. Instead of using Gump technology to doctor tapes,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> the president and his homies have been jetting about. While the Prez and the first Chick have been in Brazil, Gore has been lecturing weather forecasters on the inevitable effects of Global Warming.<br><dd>   Despite the fact that numerous industrialized nations have begun serious talk about setting emission standards, the United States, land of the free, home of the brave, and apparently of land mines and gads of carbon dioxide emissions, has refused to sit down and talk about. At first blush, this seems to be the real scandal. Was there a rift between the President and his Vice? Is Gore a rogue politician, miles across and ready to collide with the earth, causing massive destruction-oh! I mean, is he going against the party line and doing what he genuinely feels to be right...even before the opinion polls are back to tell him what is right? No. Stop being cynical!<br>   <dd>  As is usually the case, there's more going on here than most people realize. Though global warming is pretty much accepted as fact by most sentient denizens on the planet, the European idea of cutting back on emissions is, well... so European. Packed with a rich and full history, our Euro spending brothers across the pond are, all and all, a boring, reactionary lot. Whenever a problem arises there's always the rise of conservatives calling for a "return to our roots." It happens in the United States as well, but here, they mean the 1950's. In Europe, they usually mean the Roman Empire, Holy or Plain flavors. Rallys where men dressed as gladiators throw Christians to large, timid ally cats are common in Italy whenever the unemployment goes above 15%. When formulating how to deal with global warming and the steady death of pine forests from air pollution, the Europeans were forced to compromise with the Luddites and roll back emissions.<br><dd>  The American's, known for thinking outside the box, have come up with a better scheme to deal with it. For the purposes of saving what is near and dear to them-cars, television, and the mighty all beef patty- they're willing to do anything...except give up their cars, television, and their cow pattys (uh, yeah).<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images8/1.2.gif"><br>     <dD> Truth be told, between you, me and the hedgehog, global warming from greenhouse gasses isn't all that important to most humans. In fact, most Americans would like the world to be a bit warmer.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> The real problem is that all the deforestation around the Equator has reduced the earth's massive midriff, causing it to rotate faster.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> Since temperature is average kinetic energy, and all of the earth's mass is speeding up, the planet is warming. While global warming might mean New York City will have to replace taxi's with gondolas ("Hey! I'm poling here!"), the change in the planets rotational speed screws up television reception because all those fancy geosynchronous satellites are still going the old speed.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>    Damn it! That's unacceptable. I want my MTV!<br>   <dd>  Endeavoring to protect every American's God Given Right&#153; to cable television, the government has called upon various brain trusts to develop policies aimed at restoring the Earth's baby-makin' hips. One of the more ambitious concepts, made almost realistic thanks to NAFTA (God, what hasn't NAFTA done for us?) and Clinton's recent trip to Brazil, was the largest US proposed construction project since the WPA.<br><dd>   Under this plan, the United States and nearly every other nation along the equator with the exception of Chad,<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#164;</A> would enter a historic agreement to construct the largest mall in history. Stretching 12,756.3 kilometers, this tribute to Freeman Dyson would span the globe like rubber bands on sheep testicles, but instead of causing testicles to shrivel up and fall off, the mall would restore the needed mass to the Earth's equator.  Voila, problem solved.  Mass restored, mall erected, cultures marked down.  The Yanomamo must go! As a bonus, the sanctity of American pop culture would be upheld and introduced to tribes that currently don't know the joy of seatless pants. But the mall would have several drawbacks, starting with the long lines for the mag-lev monorail system (propelled by the super power of superconducting,  yttrium barium copper oxide infused collectible Freaky Freezies which are appropriately  supercooled by Dairy Queen Blizzards&#153;), and copious amounts of human waste slurry pumped into the southern edge of the Sargasso Sea, eventually enabling it to be mined for coal. Unfortunately, projections showed there would be the worst ethnic battles in the history of the world, due to the cross-cultural differences of the mall rats. Spurred on by the stresses of the holiday season, the worst of the mall rats would form a neo-warsaw pact and vow to oppress the thousands of janitors dressed up as Santa Claus, resulting losses of sales approaching three easy payments of US$19.99 and destabilizing the mall's structure in the segment off the coast of Easter Island.<br><dd>  Because the US didn't want to piss off Chad at any cost (that's one country you don't cross. They'll crush you like a grape), the mall was placed on the back burner. Luckily the boys at NASA have, of course, been on top of the accelerating earth problem for years...just like the rest of us. The difference is they knew about it and were thinking up ways to stop it. When good old John said, "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things," what do you think he was referring to?  Our boys, God bless'em, have been making a flotilla of Boeing Sea Launch platforms with rockets that make the Saturn 5 look like a Geo Metro. They plan to spread them out along the equator with the business end pointed to the sunset in an attempt to slow the rotation of the Moon's moon (it's all relative, baby). Unfortunately, they've been busy defending their budget and acting like AAA for the world's orbiters, leaving little time to complete their goals in recent years, much less by the end of the 1960's.<br><IMG  width = 300 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images8/1.3.gif"><br><dd>    In the mean time, all the cows we've had in the little latitudes have been helping slow things down, but physicists realize the mass of a cow is much less than that of a tree, let alone a Dysonian mall, and we simply can't achieve a high enough bovine density...unless we stack them like cordwood, which tends to make the cows less viable. Recent years have seen advances in effective bovine densities by creating smaller cows with leaner meat. Packed into Japanese style apartment complexes, some more advanced beef producers can approach a gigacow per cubic kilometer, which is really pushing the envelope. That's 10 cows in the area of one normal cow. Small cows means less mass, however, and no matter how many midget cows you have, they're still stupid looking. What we need are super cows! Giant, genetically engineered super cows towering majestically hundreds of feet in the air...totally without heads thanks to new cloning technology. If you think Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (RBGH) is just for more milk, you're sadly mistaken.<br> <dd>    Mind you, such an undertaking just can't be done in one generation.<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#131;</A> It has to be done gradually, and our cattle are already starting to evolve into Megacattle, friend of all children. In fact, the average domestic cow has gotten bigger,<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#6">&#181;</A> but the experimental cows are already ten times larger than their domestic cousins. This will solve a number of problems. First and foremost, the giant cow will replace the trees around the equator and keep the Earth aligned to the precious satellites. Second, big cows mean big beef. Every Good American&#153; wants more beef-think economies of scale. Of course there's the issue of all that supersized feces, but all that nitrate has to be good for something. Anyhow, the plan is that by the year 2001, we'll have massive farms of six story cows spread about the Equator, bringing balance and peace to the world. Well, ok...maybe just balance. Least until some drunk frat boys push one of those bad boys over. </td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A>And don't kid yourself: they had more than enough time to alter the video tapes that Republicans have been watching with more interest than "Sperminator 2, Judgement Spray." Imagine President Clinton portrayed as a bastion of virtue as wealthy white slavers from Asia kneel at his feet offering him jewels, concubines, and fists full of money. "No, no! Take these poor, misguided souls away!" They could have done it, but they didn't.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135;</A> One of GDT's own is personally attempting to make the Great Plains a shallow ocean again.
