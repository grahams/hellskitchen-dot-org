For those so uninformed, Orbitz&#153; is, for lack of a better word, an ornamental beverage. It is marketable only because it has little floating non-nutritive pellets in it-as if this is a magical panacea which will make people better able to stomach the excruciatingly thick high fructose corn syrup vinaigrette that suspends the spheres.<br><dD>  People will try it, since every Good American&#153; has forgotten all about high school physics and the concept of equal density materials and aqueous suspensions making them prime targets for this alien concoction, but that doesn't necessarily make them genuinely stupid enough to buy it twice.<br><dd>   Rather, it takes an independent marketing group to question, filter, and calculate their way to gobs of cash at initial release and veritable tens of repeat customers. They then convinced Clearly Canadian&#153; investors to dump their hard earned Loonies into development of a machine to produce nutritionally neutral (can you say <I>Sphingomonas elodea</I> fermentation?) balls which will suspend in a mix of 8 fluid ounces of water and the entire sugar production of a small village in South America. I'd wager it was the same group that determined that what the Public really wanted was a cola without all that pesky artificial carmel color, and the same group who determined that everybody is willing to sacrifice a solid stool to have Doritos with the fat content of rice cakes.<br><dd>    As the initial hype crumbles around Orbitz&#174, the first attempt to increase the number of repeat customers will probably be to try to fix a nonexistent problem in the details of the product, not the concept itself. I'm sure there's a core group studying the problem right now saying things like, and "perhaps little cubes would be more appreciated," "maybe Cantaloupe Mayonnaise Haba&#241;ero would be a fresh flavor," and "we should focus on the `texturally enhanced' aspects and back off on the `fruit-flavored phlegm' angle." The inevitable conclusion is a failed product, another company filing Chapter 11, and a small, lame brain trust firing their collective single ganglion over and over on a nearly impossibly less intelligent general population.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images8/orbitz2.gif"><br><dd>   In a rare <A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#first">&#134;</A></A> possibility, Orbitz&#174; could be the start of a major trend of "refrigerator furniture." I mean, think about it <A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></A> -five and a half foot tall Barbie&#174; Dream Houses&#153; with air conditioning, automatic lighting and three vinyl coated wire floors. One could decorate the inside of their cold food storage device like never before. Mind you, only the most uncool Sam's Club shoppers will buy the food shaped like faux couches and chairs, perhaps in American Vernacular&#153; styles reminiscent of mobile homes of the 1950's. Everyone else will be beating down the doors of the local food repository for the latest colored, textured, and patterned beverages, Naugahyde upholstered Arm & Hammer Baking Soda, and pickle jars designed in homage of Frank Lloyd Wright's Waterfall House to match the existing decor of their Hotpoint. The best part being, of course, that once you've consumed the products you have the option of completely redecorating.<br>  <dD>   Of course, like all fads, at some point it's doomed to obscurity once its run the gauntlet of any gimmicks lifecycle. First will be paid endorsements in popular movies. We'll see Buffy in Buffy the Vampire Slayer-The Television Series-The Movie two years from now quaffing not Clearly Canadian Blackberry like Kristy Swanson, but rather some multi-density, layered, textured drink from the same company with a satisfied but pained smile and a glance to the camera. Then will come hundreds of product knock-off's, trying to jump on the rickety bandwagon of the original idea. Not soon after that comes Saturday Night Live (ironically in and of itself a failing fad) parodying the product.  Finally, as we near the end of the life of the textured beverage, the only remaining factory sealed Orbitz&#174; bottles will join Flo-Bee's and embalmed McDLT's on the shelves of incurable collectors as yet another homage to all the stupid ideas which fall into an unending (but thankfully ever fading) cycle of being "retro" every 30 years or so.<br> <br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="first"><hr width=50% align=left><A NAME="2"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134;</A> That is, rare in a sort of intelligent life on other planets also inventing the Clapper kind of way.<BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164;</A>  "I mean, think about it" Copyright &#169; 1997 Sean Hammond.
