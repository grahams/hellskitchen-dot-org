"It was one of the big 96 set boxes. He even ate the shavings in the little sharpener on the back."<br>   <dd>  Reportedly under a great deal of stress, Wannabee, the layout editor of the <I>Iconoclast</I>, apparently leapt to his doom from the top of his dorm room's door frame.<br> <dd>    Besides the normal crushing load of work associated with college life, Wannabee apparently had been spending more and more time finding material on the internet to plagiarize.<br>   <dD>  "All I wanted to do was make people happy. When I got that email about Mir and Mother Teresa going to hell, I thought they were submissions. How was I to know?" said a suicide note found on the scene. The note went on to extensively quote Nietzsche,  and, ironically, babbled incoherently about journalistic integrity.<br>  <dd>   "He probably did the world a favor," said Dr. William Lutz, English professor on the Camden-Rutger's campus and editor of the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> for 34 years. "If I had done what he did, I'd kill myself too."<br>  <dd>   Just prior to his suicide, Wannabee called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. After heading the details of the planned and intentional use of copyrighted material, the operator calmly told him, "Put the gun back in your hand. Step closer to the edge. Think about jumping. Think about it!"<br>  <table width = 250><tr><td valign = top><center><IMG   SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol8/images8/jumper.gif"><br><B>Above: A dramatic representation of Matthew Wannabe's plummet to death.</center></B></td></tr></table> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/8/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br> <!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
