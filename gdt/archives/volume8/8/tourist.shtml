As for mindless action in a film, John Woo illustrates a possible flaw in such logic.  "Face-Off" was a good film, but it could have ended ten times before it actually did.<br>   <dD>   The plot was good until the part when John Travolta and Nicky Cage had their faces swapped.  Right then and there it become predictable and trite.  If I were to have made the movie, I would have done things very differently.  First off, Travolta would have been clad in his white jumpsuit from "Saturday Night Fever," because his films of late have been described as nothing but "stylish" and I think he needs to get back to his roots.<br>     <dd>   Second, the real plot would begin when the vat of mung (this mung is scarin' me, Wayne) that Travolta's face is in gets knocked over.  His face spills out onto the floor whereupon a stray lab dog snatches it up and runs out of the hospital.  From then on, it's a head to head chase- man versus dog.  Travolta must find the dog that has been chewing on his face, capture him, then dispense with him in Woo style with some sort of hurled projectile.<br>     <dD>   When his face is finally reattached, it is all mangled and decaying and slobbered upon.  Nicholas Cage would play Travolta from then on, rendering the film into a heartwarming drama that brings to mind "Mask," and "The Elephant Man," as Travolta struggles to cope with his new handicap.  He'd loose work, become an alcoholic ("Leaving Las Vegas," anyone?), and end up scaring pre-pubescent children at middle school assemblies.  Ten years from now, when Travolta's career is in a REAL slump, he could do the sequel, "Face-On," which would involve lots of foam latex and our friends at ILM.<br>      <dd>  Oh yeah, as for "Mimic," I only have one question:  when the huge bugs were running amuck where the fuck was the Orkin Man?  If I had that way cool space suit/exterminator outfit, I certainly wouldn't be vegging out in front of the tube!  I'd be down in the sewers of New York, kicking some mad-roach ass.<br>     <dd>  Next time anyone makes a movie about insects and pest control, please consult the writings of William S. Burroughs-any problem could be solved with bug powder. No, I'm serious.  Just do me a favor and rub some on my lips....<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/index.html">Other Issues</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/welcome.html">Other Volumes</A> -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume8/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
