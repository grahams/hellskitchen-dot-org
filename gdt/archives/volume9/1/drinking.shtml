Of course for Swedes there really is no bad time to flash the neighbor's hound. In the spirit of such unconditional giving as the Swedes often demonstrate, GDT is prepared to teach you a few new-and quite old-drinking games that you might not have heard of before. Drinking games throughout history have always required stamina, cunning, and guile. Oh yeah, and a high tolerance for low proof alcohol and a bladder that has it's own agenda.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images1/1.1.gif"><br><dd>The first unrecorded drinking game (actually, it was called a "Salting game" for reasons that will become clear. Read along. There's nothing to see here.)  in history came out of Sumaria around 4000BCE. The only reason we are privy to this information is because of a couple quite graphic, and mostly non-existent, tablets that were not found in the great library of Ashurbanipal at Nineva located on the beautiful Tigris River. The game itself was quite complicated, and only after a series of long, drawn-out tortuous ordeals, was the "player" allowed a small swig of wine, which everybody drank anyway. As a part of the game, the revelers shouted, "Svitzcha!,"<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> and threw salt over their shoulder and was used as a way to test a "player's" metal in a pre-bronze age society (about a week later and they would have been in the bronze age). <br><dd>As drinking games were just invented they had not yet realized what the true purpose of a drinking game is: to get drunk and act stupid. They had the stupid part down cold, what with the salt throwing, but were a little behind in the inebriation field.<br><dd>Because this first game was invented in the enlightened society of the Sumarians it did not take them long to catch on...just look at the circle (prime piece of marketing that was).<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> Unlike the Sumarians, the more uncouth civilizations just getting the hang of agriculture just wanted to have a nice tall one, and didn't want to go through all that other muck to get at it. The Sumarians were smart, but not all that smart. Then again, neither were the afore mentioned uncouth ones; they kept the salt throwing in because they thought the alcohol wouldn't work without it.<br><dd>The game became wildly popular and spread quickly across the known world (all forty-four hectares of it) eventually making its way to the flourishing societies of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus river valley, who until this time, had only known of the less engaging party games of pin the tail on Flloyd ("Ow! Quit it! Why don't you guys go play Kick-the-Sandstone or something?") and kick the sandstone. These early Indus civilizations just couldn't get enough of this new drinking game (and neither could Flloyd) and ended up occupying all of their otherwise unoccupied time in playing the game. This resulted in vast quantities of salt being flung about and eventually making their soil too saline to sow their seeds. Their once great civilization then went the way of Selfosophy in Utah, never to be heard of again.<br> <dd>(As an interesting side note, the Salt Drinking Game, having disappeared for millennia, suddenly reappeared in the biggest party the Mediterranean ever saw. Shortly after the Carthigians invited the Romans over for a party, someone broke out a store of salt and taught everyone how to play. After a week of cavorting and merriment ("Hell of a joke, you bringing those Elephants to our party last time.") Carthage was a mess and reduced to a saline wasteland. Hell of a party, though.)<br> <dd>A major innovation to drinking games came with the rise of the Minoan civilization. Until this time most drinking games had never really incorporated the cause and effect status of modern drinking games (ex. Roxanne). In fact, it was the other way around: "When I drink, I've got to throw some salt." With the rise in trade and commerce among different civilizations, the concept of cause-and-effect was hit upon. The really advanced groups came to look for a cause and effect in everything.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A> Enter early Minoan Society: naked, broken legged fisherman who let young boys and girls jump over bulls for kicks. <br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images1/1.2.gif"><br><dd>They had to be drunk.<br><dd>The game they played consisted of taking a drink every time some strong, nubile youth flipped themselves, ass over end, over the marauding beast. Two if the youth made it. All you can drink if two of the youngsters collided in the air.<br><dd>The next great innovation in drinking games was introduced by the great and wacky religion of Judaism, and was called Passover Dinner. The Hebrews successfully married the solemn occasion of religious ritual with the fun of consuming vast quantities of alcohol, without turning the whole thing into an orgy like the less successful versions of the Roman's Bacchus drinking game. The Bacchus drinking game mostly consisted of taking a drink whenever you saw someone and then having sex with the closest available sheep ("If the sheep doesn't say no, it's not rape"). Oddly enough some forms of the early Roman game seem to continue on to this very day, even though most of the religious meaning may be lost, it was probably lost about the time they invented it in the first place (see hazing).<br><dd> Innovation being the hallmark of the Western alcoholic, games continued to grow, spread, prosper, be repressed, go underground, form a guerrilla movement, topple the Powers-that-Be, and prosper. Over the centuries, several games have been lost, but thanks to some intense pleading to Hell Inc., the Bacchus Corp has supplied us with a few less interesting games than we've already covered:<p><center><B>The Catholic Drinking Game - a.k.a. Communion</B></center><p><dd>Christianity not seeing why the Jews should have all the fun created this game to honor the lord their Father and their less than respectable cannibalistic sides. As with most modern religious drinking games (quite unlike the Bacchus game) the game is either not played often enough, or the interval between drinks is a little too substantial, like a week, for most heavy drinkers to fully enjoy it's subtly nuances. Ultimately this game often loses it's purer nature in the banal pageantry of modern day Catholicism.<br>  <dd>The game is played like this:<br><dD>The parishioners endure forty-five minutes of dogma, then the Priest says, "Let us proclaim the mystery of our faith." Everybody drinks. Communion is finished, the Mass ends, everybody goes home for a week and returns the following Sunday. Repeat.<br><dd>One can only imagine how much more satisfying Mass must have been in the age of Pope Alexander VI.<p><center><B>The Drinking Game Drinking Game</B></center><p><dd>This game is about as simple as it gets and reflects the minimalism of our times. Every time you take a drink, you have to take a drink.<br> <dd>This game will only end upon the occasion:<br><dd>a) that you pass out<br><dd>b) that you die<br><dd>c) that you run out of things to drink<br><dd>It is advisable never to play this game around Drano or household cleaning fluids.<p><center><B>Advisory Aviatory Drinking Game of Admiral Byrd</B></center><p><dd>This game was created by the great explorer and pilot Admiral Byrd. The game consists of becoming scared to death of flying, drinking enough to bloat a camel and only then setting foot on an airplane. Once on board the plane you become so disastrously frightened that you nearly cause the pilot to crash.<br> <dd>Repeat as many times as you need to take flight. This game is given a TDDYP rating (Till Death Do You Part).<p><dD>So just remember the what makes an alcoholic and the ways to avoid accusations of being one. In this festive holiday season, drinking games not only cover our drug use for purposes so noble as burying our vicious emotions, but also keep us from drinking alone. Don't get MADD get even&hellip;more drunk, and then just see what happens.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A> Cheers. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135; </A> In addition to being top notch astronomers and mathematicians (case in point: the Nineva constant. A number which divides into the orbit of each planet, most moons, and several of the larger asteroids evenly), they were the world's best marketers. The phrase "He could sell the Devil a glass of water"<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a> really does not do them justice. Prior to their foray into the rough and tumble world of pre-Iron Age marketing, most cultures and tribes made do with what they had, and what they had mainly consisted of squares. Striving for an increased geometric density, early researchers diligently worked on new shapes (Ah, square? No. Ah, square? No. Oh! I got it! How about a square?"). After centuries of circular reasoning ("Hey!") Wesslie the Daft from the Anatolian Plateau mistakenly left a cross bar off one of his experiments and the triangle was born. Ridiculed by the Society of Squares ("What kind of square is that? Kind of lacking in sides, isn't it?") it was discovered that the triangle could handle more weight using fewer sides. A break through in geometric density! The Sumarians, scoffing at their superfluous sided shapes, presented the circle. Totally new ("Hey! You just cut a part out of a tree."), or at least mostly new, the circle proved to be so innovative and practical that it was mostly ignored as a tool for centuries, due mainly to the extensive owner's manual that carefully explained each of the 360 degrees<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#167;</A></a> and blathering on about arc's and angles and snake pies. Consisting of only two sides (inside and outside), it had only one practical load bearing surface. Unfortunately, it tended to roll away from where it was set down, causing a great deal of confusion. The first real use of the circle in a architectural project was by Imhotep the Feeble when he attempted to fuse the three major geometric forms in a theory of Unified Geometry or just give good old King Zoser a better view from his picture window in the after-life. The resulting Step Pyramid fused all three: with distances measured with the circle, squares used to make rectangles, the entire shape was roughly a triangle. Hailed as a major breakthrough, the new Unified Geometry was refined to the point of making the Great Pyramid at Gizeh. Seen by many modern whackos as a source of ancient knowledge, they cite the fact that the Great Pyramid contains pi in its very structure as proof that the ancients weren't all stupid enough to be gold plating their sculptures using grape juice powered batteries. Of course it has pi in it you prats! They measured the length of sides with a circle. Even if they didn't know about Pi it would be a part of the structure. Sheesh! <BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#165;</A> "Now, if yous don't have that shipment a' fish you promised, my boy 'll h've to break you legs. Nothing pers'n'l.

Ol' Club Foot is parched most of the time. <BR><A HREF="#5.5">&#167; </A> While humans tended to overlook the circle, the Gods of old were quite taken with the idea. They were so impressed that they decided to adopt the circle with it's 360 degrees as the solar standard. The length of days and the orbit of the Sun around the Earth were adjusted to the year was exactly 360 days. For millennia the earth's systems relied solely on the 100% Pure Circle system. By the time of Persephone a new operating system called Ellipse had begun to gain in popularity and several aspects of it were incorporated into Circle. The hybrid system worked effectively until 1582AD when the number of internal errors caused a massive crash and caused the irretrievable loss of 10 days. Rather than have to rewrite the entire system (a serious pain because it was written in base 60 planet code, and no one scripts in base 60 anymore), Pope Gregory the 13th created a work-around altering the length of each day and causing the length of each year to be 365.256328 days, proving once again that when you measure an object you change it's nature. Sure, the system's sloppy, but it works for now. <BR></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/jo.html">Jason Olshefsky </A><p></td></tr></table><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
