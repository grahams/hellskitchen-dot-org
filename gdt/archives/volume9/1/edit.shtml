A bitter, short man with coal for a heart, I would rail against Reporter, questioning why it consistently wins national awards when faculty, staff, and students all complain about it's content. Notice the past tense: I was banned by my counterpart from senselessly attacking the Reporter. Imagine my surprise when Kelly Gunter coquettishly said, "I want to write an editorial about one of Reporter's editorials." Well I'll be damned. In short, I didn't write this editorial, but I do agree.</I><p><font size = +3>T</font size>his editorial is actually a rebuttal of sorts. Sean has been banned from writing more meaningless editorials about the <I>Reporter Magazine</I> for his habit of writing something up every other week, but the rest of us are free to write as we please. It is not often my interest to even think of the <I>Reporter</I>, but I saw a bit of drivel that was supposed to pass for an editorial and got annoyed at the presumptuousness of the head editor, Ms. Harsch.<br><dd>The October 24th issue of the <I>Reporter</I> was apparently controversial; some students threw 3,000 of their copies in the trash. I wasn't really paying attention...I've got better things to do. In the next week's <I>Reporter</I> editorial, dealt with in their usual stylistic manner, the words "Censorship by Students?" somehow were plastered all over the page. Mind you, I didn't find out about this until a few days after the issue. I was visiting a teacher and spotted the issue in question on their desk open to the editorial. It intrigued me for a moment, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about and read it.<br><dd>The editorial spouts off all of brilliantly patriotic crap about "THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS" and first amendment rights, and it really it brought a tear to my eye. <br><dd>Really.<br><dd>It went on to accuse those students who threw out the <I>Reporter</I> issues of not believing in those fore mentioned rights and most importantly "guilty of censorship." I'm sorry Ms. Harsch, but I'm going to have to ask you to get down off your high horse. I could much more easily prove that the three branches of the government are a farce than you could prove these students are guilty of censorship. I'm afraid, my dear, that you don't even have the slightest clue of what you are saying.<br><dd>First, and most importantly, what you must know to make a statement like that is what exactly censorship is. According to Steve's Big Book of Everything<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> censorship is the work of a censor, and a censor is one who works in an official capacity to suppress information on political, moral, military, or other grounds. A censor works in an official capacity. <I>Reporter</I> is censored when Al Simone (President of RIT) leans down from on high and says, "No, don't print that." What the students did to your publication was not censorship, because they do not work in an official capacity.<br> <dd>The second point I'd like to make is that the students you accused of said action in no way oppressed your freedom of press. You were able to print what you liked, and you did. The publication you created is what allegedly hit those newsstands. Freedom of the press ensures that you will be able to write what you want and print it. After you place your issues in the public domain they become public property to be dealt with in any manner your reading public sees fit to behave towards it. You have no rights to dictate to others how your publication should be treated once you relinquish your control over it.<br><dd> The next important issue I believe this raises, which your article failed to mention, is free speech. Free speech protects some actions, such as flag burning, as well as protecting one's freedom of speech. The students who threw the <I>Reporter Magazines</I> away were merely exercising their right. It was their choice of action, and with it they made a statement, and should not be condemned for such an action.<br><dd>For several years now <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> has been printing questionable articles-writing more than worthy of a little outrage. I have no idea how many times our issues have seen the inside of a trash can. Our fifth issue of volume one nearly got obliterated by one guy on a mission. In those days we paid for everything out of our pockets, granted we were not too pleased, but we also understood why he did it and could not condemn his actions. In fact, we replied to his hate mail and encouraged him to continue to express his rights...once he was better informed of the issues at hand. As a subtle statement, Hell's Kitchen learned from our experiences and includes a recycle symbol on the cover as a means of reminding any right-minded citizen wishing to wipe our filthy rag off the face of the planet that they should at least do something worthwhile with our worthless rag. If one of our readers finds it necessary to destroy one of our issues on some basis, we concede, for it is not our place to complain (at least not in this arena). Once an issue leaves our hands, it is out of our hands. Your behavior, Ms. Harsch, would seem more commendable were you able to do the same.<br><dd>I suggest if you can not emotionally concede such points, your journal should avoid making any articles which are remotely controversial, lest the consequences offend your own person.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A> Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language.<br></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/1/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
