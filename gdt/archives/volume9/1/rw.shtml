Man made the truths himself and each truth was a composite of a great many vague thoughts. All about in the world were the truths and they were all beautiful.... There was the truth of virginity and the truth of passion, the truth of wealth and of poverty, of thrift and of profligacy, of carelessness and abandon. Hundreds and hundreds were the truths and they were all beautiful.<br><dd>"And then the people came along. Each as he appeared snatched up one of the truths and some who were quite strong snatched up a dozen of them.<br><dd>"It was the truths that made the people grotesques.... The moment one of the people took one of the truths to himself, called it his truth, and tried to live his life by it, he became a grotesque and the truth he embraced became a falsehood."</I><br><table><tr><td width = 200 valign = top align = right>-Paraphrased from <I><br>Winesburg, Ohio,<br></I> 		Sherwood Anderson<br></td></tr></table><br><dd>In the past The Religious Wrong has highlighted frightening quotations from various members of "the Religious Right," such as Pat Buchannan and Ralph Reed. This week I want to make a quick comment on what has occurred in a small high school in Kentucky.<br><dd>Fourteen year old Michael Carneal calmly inserted ear plugs into his ears, pulled out a .22 caliber hand gun that he had stolen on Thanksgiving, and opened fire on a group of students who regularly held prayer meetings prior to the start of classes for the day. When he stopped, Michael had killed three: Kayce Steger, Jessica James, and  Nicole Hadley.<br><dd>Nicole's death is significant for she was a close friend of his, was his first target, and was the only one he took the time to aim at, killing her with a slug in the brain. Obvious I'm not privy to all the facts, but I can't help but wonder about what motivated Brutus. Did he help kill Caesar to stop his ambitions or to save C&aelig;sar from corruption? Did Judas betray Jesus for the thirty pieces of silver, or because Jesus had to be killed for our sins? Where is the line between caring enough to save, and caring enough to kill...and which shows more love?<br><dd>Suffice it to say I'm saddened by what he did. I disapprove of Christians in general, but I have no plans to go out and lay them low. I'll let their Savior do that when the time comes. What bothers me is that if he did it to stop them, he became no better than they are. Violent suppression is violent suppression, be it disemboweling a witch with a rusty saw, stoning a Palestinian in the name of nationalism, or murdering misled high schoolers with lead.<br><dd>All grotesques.<br></multicol></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/rw.html">Other Religious Wrongs in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
