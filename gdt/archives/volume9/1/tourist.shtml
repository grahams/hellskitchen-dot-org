I liked it a lot.  Not because it was a good plot, or that Sly was acting again, although that was a nice change.  No, I liked this film for one reason - ass.  Hold up!  Let me explain.  Have you ever been driving along and caught of an odor so putrid you had to exclaim "Man, this place smells like ass!"?  Or have you been into someone's room and it was so messy and unkempt that you had to say "Jesus, your room looks like ass, dude."? That's what I'm talking about.  The stars of "Copland" were the embodiment of ass.  Either the makeup guy never showed up, or they hired Stan Winston's special makeup effects crew and said "Stan, you've done a lot of work in the past, `Alien,' `Jurassic Park,' `Terminator 2,' we like it.  Is there a way that you can make Sylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Harvey Keitel, and Robert Patrick look like ass?"  <br><dd>Stan must have said yes.<br>  <dd>The movie starts, and you see that most of the characters look as if they've been collectively hit by an amtrack train...daily.  The industry standard of three-day growth on the lead males was extended to twelve or thirteen day-growth (and I bet if you look real hard, you can see small insects playing 'smear the queer' in Robert Patrick's stubble).  Cathy Moriarty plays a trampy housewife to one of the cops, and when she opens the door to speak with Sly, I had two reactions:<br> <dd>1.  How many times did they beat her across the face with a shovel?<br> <dd>2.  Did they add the implied "Booty Rot" smell in post production?<br> <ss>Smell was a major factor.  There is no such thing as smell-o-rama at Movies Ten, but still!  I wanted to leave the theatre, grab some Altoids from CVS, and throw their curiously strong goodness at Harvey Keitels mouth!  You know a film smells bad when the word "Fuck" smells like cheap whiskey, cigarettes, and day old cheese steak sub.  As an audience member in a regular theatre, I shouldn't know what Sly had for dinner two nights ago!  Robert De Nero was in the film as well. He didn't really have to have anything altered, except for some extra hair coming out of his mole. There are films that try to emulate real life, this was one of them. Corruption in the New York Police force, a small town sheriff caught in the middle of a conspiracy, the mob owning an entire police precinct, I can believe all that.  What I found hard to believe is the total lack of personal hygiene in the film!  Cops have access to soap!  They could probably score a few bottles of Listerene if they tried.  I don't think that internal affairs would object to a cop using a razor from time to time!  I like that movies are getting back to their naturalistic roots, but there can be too much realism.  People go to movies to escape reality, not to wipe  it off their shirt collars every time some wino-cop calls Stallone a "Deaf Fuck."<br>     <dd>All in all, it was a good film.  If you liked the video for the Beastie Boys' "Sabotage," you'll dig "Cop Land."  Hey!  Wait a sec.  What if we could get the Beasties for the sequel? "Copland 2:  Return of the Brass Monkey."    <br>  <center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images1/tourist2.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>Beasties: Circa Brass Monkey</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br></center></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/1/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
