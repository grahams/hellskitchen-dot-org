Consider this extra special holiday issue of GDT to exist half in the world where you wished you had chosen to wear a more befitting shirt for your pants, and half where you wished you had put those self-same pants on in the right direction. Enjoy <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> as if looking down the wrong pant leg, and then again as if looking down the other wrong pant leg. This week we give you two head articles for the price of none. There will be a brief intermission after the first article in which the the Vienna Boys Choir will sing "Adolf the Red Faced Nazi" and then the second article will begin.<br><dd>   Remember, Dickens is dead. This must be understood...<p><hr width = 300><br><font size = +3>C</font size>harles Dickens is dead. This must be understood if anything wonderful is to come of this story. Hawthorne is dead too, thank god. Come to think of it, there are a lot of dead authors: Ayn Rand, Frank Herbert, Shakespeare, Dr. Seus, Theodore Dostroveski, Camus, Jean Paul Sarte and a whole handful of others. H. Jackson Brown Jr. isn't dead, but he really should be for what he brought into the world. And while we're on the topic of people who should be dead, let's talk about Scrooge.<br><dd>Jim The-Hammer Scrooge (a traditional Balinese name. Incidentally when translated into German it means "Mentos") was one of those genuinely nice people who are cursed with a name that caused Eskimos to burst, for it translated in eskimali to "Mentos." Due to this unfortunate translation he developed an over-compensation complex which caused him to try to make the world a better place to live through the altruism of pimping. Every time Scrooge's altruistic spirit serves another satisfied customer the world suddenly contains an extra one armed midget with jaws of steel, burped from the bowels of hell. These midgets come into existence angry, maladjusted, and with a predisposition to licking knee-caps. Instead of hand, these one armed bastards have an adamantium dradle; they evolved that way in order to ward off vicious predators<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> from their native dimension. <br><dd>How many licks does it take to get to the center of a human beings knee? This is a question often asked in clever midget bastard mini-school. The entire midget economy has been working to solve this very conundrum. Clever midget philosophers work round the incense clock to solve it. The major barrier the midgets have to overcome in quickly and decisively licking through patellae is their own tongue. This is referred to in the native midget lingo as the "salivatory barrier," which incidentally sounds a lot like "!Men!tos."  Their tongues resemble stubby rubber gloves, minus the digits, and smell like them too. In prehistoric midget times, the early clever midget bastard race began as gastropods,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> recklessly flinging their tongues about in order to move and show love to their companions.<br> <IMG  width = 300 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images2/1.1.gif"><br> <dd>Unbeknownst to Jim The-Hammer Scrooge, his best efforts to improve the conditions of the world were being counter-acted by these vicious balls of dradle-tipped clever midget terror. In an attempt to show Scrooge the folly of his ways, three spirits came to warn him of the impending microclypse....<br><dd>The spirit of the past tried his damnedest to reach through Scrooge's warm exterior, but his autism posed a serious problem. Beyond his drooling and continual rocking motion his only means of communication was through a small chess set.<br><dd>"What do you want of me?"<br><dd>Queen's rook to pawn three.<br><dd>"What?"<br><dd>King's Bishop takes pawn.<br><dd>"Look this doesn't make any sense."<br><dd>Queen to King's pawn two.<br><dd>"Well, I'm going now, okay?" Scrooge wandered off and found himself staring into the eyes of an ass...<br><dd>"Where are we, Spirit?" asked Scrooge as he struggled to remain upon the back of the donkey he rode upon by fighting back the groping arms of the horde of scantily clad men and women. Astride the same animal rode the Spirit of Today, seemingly unaffected by the seeking hands of the people around him. The already drunk Spirit somehow managed to drink from a whiskey bottle, despite the swaying of the donkey.<br><dd>"Sure'in ya don't know the place?" asked the Spirit of the Present in a thick Irish accent.<br><dd>Scrooge looked about him. All he could see were carbon copy houses erected in the Ticky-tacky style of the late baby-boom era. The only difference was the colour of the home, how many midgets surrounded it, and the amount of Christmas lighting outside.<br><dd>"I've never been here in my life," answered Scrooge.<br><dd>"Ah don't blame ya. Tell ya the truth, I've never been here meself. But don't ya worry, me ass knows the way," he said patting the donkey on the head.<br><dd>The Spirit found this amusing, and in his laughing, threatened to topple the donkey, but the Gropers surrounding Scrooge helped right the Spirit and steady him. As soon as he had stopped laughing, he turned and handed the bottle to Scrooge.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images2/1.2.gif"><br><dd>"Have a hoot."<br><dD>Soon they approached an unremarkable house. The donkey stopped and merely stood.<br> <dd>"Ah, here we are then."<br><dd>The Spirit of Today left his mount shakily. Many of his Gropers rushed to his aid that he wouldn't fall. Even as they held him up, he called ,"I'm alright! I'm alright!"<br><dd>"What the heck is that!" he shrieked as he suddenly found his knees moist and tingling, "Get it off man! Get it off!" When the clever midget bastard was extracted from his knee, the Spirit continued on.<br><dd>Slowly, the Spirit wove his way to the window with Scrooge following close behind.<br><dd>"Oh yeah. This is where the Cratchits live. Come look at what will happen today."<br><dd>Scrooge drew close to the dark window and suddenly light burst forth from the room. Instead of a dark nighttime room, Scrooge watched the Christmas Lunch that would happen later that day.<br>A woman Scrooge assumed to be Mrs. Cratchit was busy at the microwave, feverishly trying to crisp midgets,<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#165;</A></a> then having to rotate the remains.<br> <dd>Soon Bob Cratchit stumbled into the room burdened under the weight of many midgets. Bob's back was covered with tongue burn. Just behind Bob, a group of midgets carried a large child, and the poor midgets wove from side to side under the enormous weight. They carry him off to another room from which a high-pitched squealing noise is heard.<br><dd>"Who is that child?" Scrooge asked with a snicker.<br><dd>The Spirit looked through the window while taking another drink. "That's Gigantic Tim. Bit roomy ain't he?"<br><dd>"What's the problem with him."<br><dD>"Oh, some dradle game these midgets play, very religious these midgets. Clever group though. He'll get over it."<br><dD>The child was beyond belief. His sounds were incredible for a child of only seven.<br> <dD>"Spirit, no more, I beg of you," Scrooge gasped.<br><dd>Suddenly the light from the window vanished and a cold wind began to blow.<br><dd>"Oh oh," murmured the Spirit as the smile disappeared from his face.<br> <dd>"Well, ha, my time here is done," said the Spirit as he hurried to his donkey. Coming down the road was a figure dressed all in black. "Got to go. Previous engagement ya know." The Spirit's band quickly went down a side street and were gone.<br><dd>The figure approaching was a woman. She wore a long black dress, and walked with quick, deliberate steps. Her jaw and cheek bones shone painfully through her taught skin. Her black hair was all worn back in a tight bun, making her bony face more accentuated. Around her neck hung a cross and on her chest was an A.A. button. She somehow exuded an anti-midget field around her.<br><dd>The Spirit of the Future was an Alcoholics Anonymous councilor.<br><dD>More than that, Scrooge got the impressing that she watched the Church Channel for inspiration.<br><dd>"Are you the...the Spirit of the Future?"<br><dd>"I am the Spirit of the Future and I show people their horrible ends that they may find their Lord Jesus. Who are you?"<br><dd>"Well, I'm Scrooge and I'm a altruist pimp."<br><dd>The Spirit nodded her head. "Very good. The first step is admitting you have a problem."<br><dd>Scrooge's perplexed mood destroyed, he turned toward the window. "Why don't you show me what will happen to Bob Cratchit."<br><dd>The window grew bright. What Scrooge saw shocked him. His niece and Bob Cratchit were passionately mauling midgets in the kitchen.<br><dd>"An all-out assault?" Scrooge asked the Spirit. "When will this start?"<br><dd>"Oh, it's already been going on for a few years in your time. I will pray for human kind."<br><dd>"What about Gigantic Tim. What happens to Tim, I mean they were killing him, or doing something."<br><dd>The scene changed. A skinny teen stood in the doorway, rolling his eyes as his father spoke to him.<br><dd>"He's skinny now."<br><dd>Inside, the now Thin frame of Tim hollered at his father.<br><dd>"Yeah, their mine. So what. It's my life."<br><dd>"You are not to keep these dradles under this roof."<br><dd>"Go to hell," Tim said as he left the room. As a second thought, he walked back in, flicked his father off, said, "they're not dradles, they're war trophies!" then walked out. Tim had become quite the midget commando once his youth and innocence were lost.<br><dd>"Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger" the Spirit hissed. "Do you see what your good ways have done?"<br><dd>"I don't see that I can change anything. How could I have started this? All I see is a woman who regularly watches `Breaking Bricks For God' and places her hand on the television to pray." Scrooge grabbed her cross and was suddenly in his own bed, his pillow in hand.<br><dd>Sighing, he settled back down and went to sleep peacefully dreaming of the many days of altruistic pimping ahead.<br><dd>It's probably just as well for Dickens that he's dead.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A> Which, coincidentally, are gargantuan super jews with huge torahs. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135; </A> "Do you eat with that mouth?"
