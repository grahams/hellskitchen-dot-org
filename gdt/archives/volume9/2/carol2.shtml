Consider this extra special holiday issue of GDT to exist half in the world where you wished you had chosen to wear a more befitting shirt for your pants, and half where you wished you had put those self-same pants on in the right direction. Enjoy <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> as if looking down the wrong pant leg, and then again as if looking down the other wrong pant leg. This week we give you two head articles for the price of none. There will be a brief intermission after the first article in which the the Vienna Boys Choir will sing "Adolf the Red Faced Nazi" and then the second article will begin.<br><dd>   Remember, Dickens is dead. This must be understood...<p><hr width = 300><br><font size = +3>C</font size>harles Dickens is dead. This must be understood if anything wonderful is to come of this story. Hawthorne is dead too, thank god. Come to think of it, there are a lot of dead authors: Ayn Rand, Frank Herbert, Shakespeare, Dr. Seus, Theodore Dostroveski, Camus, Jean Paul Sarte and a whole handful of others. H. Jackson Brown Jr isn't dead, but he really should be for what he brought into the world, but more on that later. First, let's talk about Michael Ebenezer.<br><dd>Michael was one of those unfortunates whose name gives Fate a firm handshake of recognition and makes a deal. Inheritance isn't all pentose sugars and drawing squares; names are just as powerful as any sub-cellular squidgy bits. What you call someone determines what they are.<br><dd>Writers, maybe more than anyone else, understand this. They are the word smiths and engineers of ideas that fashion realities. Anyone who has been throughly wrapped up in a book understands that the worlds between those pages are real.<br><dD>Beyond that, words have power. They capture and, ultimately, are exactly what they describe. Like catalysts in some sunny pool, they interact with one another and form more complex ideas in self-reinforcing reactions. There are certain words and phrases which have a natural affinity for each other. They fit together so naturally, so easily, that it is difficult to think of them separately. Ancient Chinese...secret. Superfluous...third nipple. Ebenezer...Scrooge.<br><dd>Words have power. Ten's of thousands of years ago when Man sat around fires, huddling against the Death that crept in the night, they took their first steps towards communication: giving their thoughts substance, reality.<br><dd>That's the key.<br><dd>Words not only reflect reality, they create it. The people living in the Middle Ages understood this and began using middle names to make sure no one could easily find out their full nomen and control them. The same can be said of the Catholic practice of taking another name once confirmed: it was an act of trust to share a potential weakness with your God and family. In recent ages, people have forgotten the power in words, but the word's never forgot. They remember and work their magic every day.<br> <IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images2/2.1.gif"><br> <dd>Name a child Alexander and they'll grow up untying their shoe laces with a knife and getting inexplicably teary eyed when they look at a globe. Catherine's tend to have obsessions with horses and are very popular with the boys. Guido's forge money, and calling a child Damien is just asking for trouble.<br><dd>So Michael Ebenezer, given a name that if it were a hereditary heart disease, would make any life insurance company laugh nervously, was treated the way he was in spite of the facts. A small, lanky boy with curly hair that tended to make him look like something seen in the darkest dreams of Robert Oppenheimer, Michael got the butt end of everything. In kindergarten his parents were constantly told that he didn't share well with the other children, even though he gave his own toys to his peers. In elementary school he was punished as a bully who stole lunch money, though he looked like a poster child for rickets because he gave his own lunch money to a rotund boy whose parents never gave him enough money to satisfy his enormous appetite.<br> <dd>All his life people heard his name, subliminally ignored the "Michael," heard "Ebenezer Scrooge," and their underworked synapses connected his name to catalytically active phrases like "cheap...skate," and "tight...wad." Being from a long line of Ebenezer's he was independently wealthy, which didn't help matters.<br><dd>So he compensated. As he grew older, he volunteered to help in the community. He never counted his change. He bought expensive, lavish gifts for people he barely knew. He donated millions to the UN. He even went so far as to sign his name "Michael E." (which made people inexplicably start humming the theme to "Beverly Hill's Cop." Not much of an improvement, but at least they weren't always checking to see if their wallet was still there). Despite all this, he couldn't escape his name. He'd give $50 to a homeless woman selling pencils and win a $100 gift certificate at Borders for being their 5,437,982nd customer. He'd give $1,000,000 to a charity and his stock would split 17 times making him more cash than there's room to write here. And so the cycle kept spiraling upward and upward as he feebly worked to escape his name.<br><dd>Now, philosophers have pondered the nature of good and evil for thousands of years without approaching the truth...and if they did get near, they promptly turned around and quickly walked away, dedicating their lives to living on top of a mountain, eating yak cheese, and trying to forget that the sound of one hand clapping was "cla." Ironically, most first year Chemistry students are closer to understanding Good and Evil than any theologian.<br><dd>Contrary to most ethics courses, Good and Evil are not relative measures, but are like light in they are both a wave and a particle. The particles of this ultimate duality are subject to osmotic pressure. Unfortunately, once they enter through the ozone layer they are altered in such a way they they can not diffuse back out into the ether. When the world has a high relative concentration of Goodness, Evil flows in to balance things out. So for every good deed done, that much more evil enters the world. The converse is also true: a bad deed done raises the level of goodness.<br><dd>The best documented case of this balancing is the World Wars. At the latter half of the 19th century people were so enthusiastic about mass production that Evil seeped in, eventually causing WWI. To offset the horrors of the worlds first industrialized war, Goodness poured in and resulted in the Roaring 20's. With all those flappers going around bobbing their hair and spreading free-love, the the inertia of the Goodness overcompensated. There was so much love, hope, and a general sense of wellbeing that a gargantuian amount of Evil was required, causing both the Great Depression and WWII.<br> <dd> That's how cool the `20's were.<br><dd>The problem is that even with the relative levels of Good and Evil balancing one-another out, the absolute levels of both have been increasing for millennia, causing greater acts of Depravity and Justice. It's generally accepted that Hitler was Bad. You can practically hear the capital letter when you talk about him. What about Pol Pot? Hitler caused the death of over 20 million. Pol Pot only caused the death of a few million. He's not <I>as</I> Bad. Do you see? Things are buzzing at a higher level, and everything we do raises the ante.<br><dd>So with the publication of books like "Life's Little Instruction Book," and "A Father's Book of Wisdom," by H. Jackson Brown Jr. (I told you we'd get back to him, Trusting Reader), the world becomes worse and worse. Better if he had written a treaty of the theoretical application of Quantum Bubbles. Imagine Michael Ebenezer, driving cars with stickers with bits of wisdom like "Practice Random Acts of Kindness," and the the damage he could do...all because he was trying to escape his name. It was intolerable! Violating some ancient and unspoken agreement Those That Watched stepped up and Acted....<dd>As Michael lay on his futon, there was a sound at his window. A light tapping. Cheerily he got up and put on his bunnyslippers just as the room was filled with a great gusting wind. Once it died down, he saw what looked like a mass of spiderwebs and dust hovering above him, furiously writing. It was a Ghost.<br><dd>Now, Michael was an enlightened New Age-er, attending Solstice ceremonies and contributing millions each year to various Pagan groups around the country, so the appearance of this wintery apparition did not fill his heart with dread. Then again, little filled his heart with dread.<br><dd>Michael was an annoyingly optimistic person.<br><dd>He expectantly waited for his visitor to speak, but when it did nothing but write for several moments, Michael felt compelled to clear his throat.<br><dd> "Uh-hum?"<br><dd>The Ghost appeared to reach the end of a sentence and looked down. "Michael," he said in a voice that could clear rust off a bumper, "Do you know who I am?"<br><dd>"I haven't the foggiest."<br><dd>"Oh," said the now confused Ghost in a more normal voice. "You are Michael Ebenezer, aren't you?"<br><dd>"Yes."<br><dd>"Well, I'm Charles Dickens."<br><dd>"Nice to meet you."<br><dd>Michael extended his hand and the Ghost looked as though he had just been offered a shoe with a duck in it. After a moment, he reached down and shook hands.<br><dd>"There really seems to have been some mistake here. You're supposed to recognize me at this point and be all quaky and scared as I use my Voice. Hmmm. But you are Michael Ebenezer at 1516 East Street, right?"<br><dd>"You've got the right guy. Care to sit down?"<br><dd>"Sit! I'd love it. You have no idea how hard it is floating around all the time and using the Voice. You don't mind me not using the Voice do you? I can if you really want the effect-"<br><dd>"Actually, said Michael hastily, "I'd rather if you didn't. It is a bit grating."<br><dd>"So, you're not going to say I'm a carrot or anything?"<br><dd>"Ah, no. But I would like to know why you're here."<br><dd>"Oh, that! Well, since you are the right person, I'm supposed to tell you that you've got to change your-Oh! Sorry. Habit. Change your Charitable ways."<br><dd>"What!"<br><dd>"Yup. No more charity for you. Best thing you could do would be to go buy some cheese and lock your self in the attic. Don't even think about applause."<br><dd>"I don't understand. I though it was, well, good to be good."<br><dd>"Exactly. And to show you the error of your ways, three Spirits will visit you tonight."<br><dd>"Including you?"<br><dd>"Ah.... Four Spirits."<br><dd>"I should have bought more tea today."<br><dd>"You have tea? Could I have some Earl Grey?"<br><dd>But even as he spoke Charles Dickens slowly faded until only his voice remained.<br><dd>"Bugger! It's been years since I had a good cup of Earl Grey...."<br><dd>Almost immediately the room was filled with a flash of light. Once his retina's had recovered Michael saw a small child rocking back and forth.<br> <dd>"Are you one of the Spirits sent to show me the errors of my ways?"<br><dd>The boy rocked back and forth in front of a chess board. Slowly he moved a pawn.<br><dD>"Wow," said Ebenezer, feeling a bit uncomfortable when nothing was said. "I haven't seen a chess set like that since I was a kid."<br><dd>More rocking. A knight was moved.<br><dd>For the next hour The Spirit of the Past tried his damnedest to reach through Scrooge's warm exterior, but his autism posed a serious problem. Beyond his drooling and continual rocking motion his only means of communication was through the small chess set.<br><dd>"What do you want of me?"<br><dd>Queen's rook to pawn three.<br><dd>"What?"<br><dd>King's Bishop takes pawn.<br><dd>"Look this doesn't make any sense."<br><dd>Queen to King's pawn two.<br><dd>"I'm starting to get a bit upset, here. Who are you, anyway? The Spirit of Bobby Fisher?"<br><dd>King's rook to bishop's pawn three.<br><dd>"Well, I'm going now, okay?" Michael wandered into the next room and found himself staring into the eyes of an ass.<br><dd>"Where are we, Spirit?" asked Michael, suddenly outside, his bunnies up to their plastic pink noses in snow. He was unceremoniously scooped up and thrown onto the back of a donkey by a horde of scantily clad men and women. Astride the same animal rode the Spirit of Today, seemingly unaffected by the seeking hands of the people around him. The already drunk Spirit somehow managed to drink from a whiskey bottle, despite the swaying of the donkey.<br><dd> "Sure'in ya don't know the place?" asked the Spirit of the Present in a thick Irish accent.<br><dd>Michael looked about him. All he could see were carbon copy houses erected in the Ticky-tacky style of the late baby-boom era. The only difference was the colour of the home, and the amount of Christmas lighting outside.<br><dD>"I've never been here in my life," answered Michael.<br><dd>"Ah don't blame ya. Tell ya the truth, I've never been here meself. But don't ya worry, me ass knows the way," he said patting the donkey on the head.<br><dd>The Spirit found this amusing, and in his laughing, threatened to topple the donkey, himself, and Michael, but the Gropers surrounding Michael helped right the Spirit and steady him. As soon as he had stopped laughing, he turned and handed the bottle to Michael.<br><dd>"Have a hoot."<br><dd>Soon they approached an unremarkable house and the donkey stopped and stood in that final and unmoving way that donkey's and camels have. After a few minutes of cursing and half hearted pushing by the Spirit's revelers, the Spirit reached a conclusion:<br><dd>"Ah, here we are then."<br><dd>The Spirit of Today left his mount shakily. Many of his Gropers rushed to his aid that he wouldn't fall. Even as they held him up, he called ,"I'm alright! I'm alright!"<br><dd>Slowly, the Spirit wove his way to the window with Michael following close behind.<br><dd>"This is where the Cratchits live."<br><dd>"You mean the people I'm going to give that free Christmas dinner to?"<br><dd>"Mmm, hmm. They didn't ask for it though, did they?"<br><dD>"Well, no. But it's Christmas. You're supposed to help those less fortunate."<br><dD>"Even if they don't want your help?"<br><dd>Michael stayed silent and drew close to the dark window. Light burst from the room revealing the Christmas lunch that would happen later that day.<br> <dd>In a cramped kitchen a woman Michael assumed to be Mrs. Cratchit was busy at the microwave, slaving away at punching buttons, then having to rotate the food. In the corner a little girl sat in a high-chair industriously sucking on her fist. Soon Bob Cratchit stumbled into the room carrying a huge child. The child was more hunched over Bob's shoulders that being carried, and the poor man wove from side to side under the enormous weight.<br><dd>"Who is that child?" Michael asked with a snicker.<br><dd>The Spirit looked through the window while taking another drink. "That's Gigantic Tim. Bit roomy ain't he?"<br><dd>"What's the problem with him."<br><dd>"Oh, some glandular thing. He'll get over it."<br><dd>The child was beyond belief. His sheer bulk was incredible for a child of only seven. More of a fleshy gastropod than a child, Michael was soon laughing at the spectacle through the window along with the Spirit. All his years of understanding and charity were horrified at what he was doing, but he couldn't help it; it was a shock reaction to the horror that was Gigantic Tim. When the dinner was served, Michael began to laugh even harder when he saw the child's plate mounded with food.<br><dd>"Spirit, no more, I beg of you," Michael gasped.<br><dd>Suddenly the light from the window vanished and a cold wind began to blow.<br><dD>"Oh oh," murmured the Spirit as the smile disappeared from his face. <br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images2/2.2.gif"><br><dd>"Well, ha, my time here is done," he said hurrying to his donkey. Coming down the road was a figure dressed all in black. "Got to go. Previous engagement ya know." The Spirit's band quickly went down a side street and were gone, save a lone triple, doing things to one another the Michael had only heard about. Sensing something was wrong, they stopped and looked up at the approaching figure. Hastily, they ran after the rest of their troop.<br><dd>The figure approaching was a fearful site, even to Michael's non-judgmental nature. It was a woman wearing a long black dress, better fashioned for times when "Show us his head!" was a favorite cheer of crowds at spectator sports.  She walked quickly, each step sharp and deliberate. Her jaw and cheek bones shone painfully in the orange glow of the city's night. Her black hair was all worn back in a tight bun, making her bony face more accentuated. Around her neck hung a cross and on her chest was an A.A. button.<br><dd>The Spirit of the Future was an alcoholics Anonymous councilor.<br><dd>More than that, Michael got the impression that she watched the Church Channel for inspiration.<br><dd>"Are you the...the Spirit of the Future?"<br><dd>"I am and I show people their horrible ends that they may find their Lord Jesus. Who are you?"<br><dD>"Well, I'm Michael and apparently I'm a sinning do-gooder."<br><dD>The Spirit nodded Her head. "Very good. The first step is admitting you have a problem."<br><dd>Michael's jovial mood destroyed, he turned toward the window. "Why don't you show me what will happen to Bob Cratchit."<br><dd>The window grew bright. What Michael saw shocked him. His niece and Bob Cratchit were passionately kissing and mauling one another in the kitchen.<br><dd>"Does you're wife know?" Michael's niece managed to say.<br><dd>"No. How could she."<br><dd>"An affair?" Michael asked the Spirit. "When will this start?"<br><dd>"Oh, it's already been going on for a few years in your time. I will pray for them."<br><dd>His niece slowly bent down, to pick up some change she had dropped, undoubtedly.<br><dd>"Ah," said Michael feeling unusually warm considering he was standing in the snow, "what about Gigantic Tim. What happens to Tim."<br><dd>Thankfully the scene changed, showing a skinny teen standing in the doorway, rolling his eyes as his father spoke to him.<br><dd>"He's skinny now."<br><dd>"Yes, the Lord healed his glands."<br><dd>Inside, the now Thin frame of Tim hollered at his father.<br><dd>"Yeah, their my pamphlets. So what. It's my life."<br><dd>"You are not going to join the Peace Corp, you Moolie!"<br><dD>"Go to hell. I leave for Guam tonight," Tim said as he left the room.<br> <dd>"Satan is in that boy," the Spirit hissed. "Do you see what your Good ways have done?"<br><dd>"I don't see that I can change anything. All my life I've tried to do things to help people, and you're telling me that for every good thing I do, a bad thing happens to balance some cosmic balance sheet. I'm sorry, but that's stupid. I don't know who's in charge, but all I see is a woman who regularly watches 'Breaking Bricks For God' and places her hand on the television to pray." Michael grabbed her cross and was suddenly in his own bed, pillow in hand.<br><dd>Sighing, he settled back down and went to sleep. The next morning he closed several manufacturing plants he owned, bought Exon, and sent the Cratchit's a rat in third class mail.<br><dd>Merry Christmas.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/2/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/mm.html">Matt Mesner</A><br></td></tr></table><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
