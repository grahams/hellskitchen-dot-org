The story behind those little yellow blobs is a long and interesting one; it's a story about life, love, and the exploitation of a little known working class. It actually describes a fascinating cycle of nature.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images3/bfg.gif"><br>   <dd>I'll start describing the cycle at the point when you go to the store and buy a box full of these delectable little edibles. You take them home with you. And on some bright and beautiful morning you spend a few fleeting moments shoveling these crunchy confections, generously embellished with lactose, down your sorry gullet. For the blue and red berries, this marks the end of their life-cycles, but for the little yellow crunchies life is just beginning.<br> <dD>They spend a remarkably educational eighteen hours touring your digestive tract. When those little tykes, for they are crunchberries in an immature stage of life, are finally flushed from your system (these days truly flushed from your system) they emerge stronger, harder, and more importantly deeply imbedded within feces.  At this point our story diverges in two directions: the historical migration of the yellow (brownish) crunchberries, and the new modern day equivalent of that same journey.<br> <DD>Unless you come from some enlightened European country or a third world nation, this next little bit does not apply to you anymore. In the olden days, when man heard the call of nature it was taken just there, to nature. Men crapped behind trees, over rocks, on the sides of churches, and in the subway, basically anywhere that was convenient. Outhouses and latrines are really not that far from the early beginnings of behavioral bowel movements such that they may be treated in the historical manner. In those days the little hardened yellow crunchberries, once excreted, would be picked up by roving gangs of earthworms, carried to a nice location, and piled up to await the time of "change". No one is clear on why the worms did this, but some have suggested that much like rats, mice, and pediphiles they like to horde materials they find pleasing to the senses.<BR> <dd>These days matters are much stranger. Modern man likes to pack his shit in large metal boxes called septic tanks and modern earthworms are having a tougher time of extracting those pre-pubescent pellets. These days earthworms are nothing better than an unskilled and exploited work force,<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> being forced to break into these impenetrable steely fortresses and retrieve these smelly larvae to carry them, sometimes hundreds of miles, all the way to the nearest Captain Crunch Factory. These poor, exhausted worms are literally working for dirt. But they feel compelled to do the labor now, if only for their children's sake. You see, today's soil is so filled with DDT, weed killer, acid rain and any other type of chemical warfare you can think of, that it is actually unpalatable for the poor worms now. So in these times that try worms entrails they must turn to Captain Crunch and the mighty corporation of Quaker as their only supplier of medium grade fertilizer.<br> <dD>Now we enter the factory floor part of the cycle. After the worms drop off their booty and get payed, all of the little stinky balls are assembled in one room. They are allowed to sit for a couple of weeks while the "change" occurs. The "change" is when the little yellow crunchberries begin to take their true form. They develop into little male crunchberries (blue) and little female crunchberries (pink). Once the yellows have changed color, the factory workers take a handful of each and toss them into a box. The box is then sealed, and allowed to be shipped via third class mail to arrive at any of the country wide distribution spots. During this long and arduous journey the crunchberries reach sexual maturity, and begin a three day long period of frenzied orgy (these circumstances can only be fostered through the third class mailing process). After three more weeks of being lost in the mail, the crunchberries have given birth, often to quintuplets, and have reared the young undifferentiated berries to a ripe age to begin the rest of their magical life journey. I hope this brings a new perspective to breakfast cereal. And thanks for the question.<br> <dd>Incidentally, when the box refers to the cereal settling in the mail, this occurs when the cereal was shipped too quickly and did not have ample time to fornicate.<br><dd>-the Bare-foot Girl<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A>They did on one occasion attempt to form a union and strike for better working conditions, but it rained and they were all flushed out to the surface.
