When one manages to do so for three hours straight, you know you've got something good.  Let me just start by saying that James Cameron is the daddy of all that which is mack.  As a filmmaker, I must say that I idolize this man.  It seems that he cannot make a bad film.  Go ahead, try to say that one of his movies sucked (except for Piranha 2: The Spawning, I yield on that one).  He really outdid himself on this one though. There was action, romance, lust, gunplay, class discrimination, secret motives, breasts, diamonds, hats, and big coats.  <br><center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images3/tourist.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>Fish bait...</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br></center><dd>When I saw the film, I had the unfortunate experience of sitting behind a bevy of pre and present-menopausal women.  They wouldn't shut up.  The dumb bitches had a comment for every goddamn moment in the film, from "Hey, I wonder if they shot this on the actual Titanic...", to "Oooh, I bet they're going to hit an iceberg because the captain is going too fast."  So you know I took a bit of personal pleasure when the crying began.  Being an emotionally bereft American male DOES have its perks from time to time.  And man did they cry.  Gallons and gallons, more even then the time that they all went out to see "Steel Magnolia's" together after Janet's divorce.  Leaving the theatre, I smiled at them and said "I heard that Cameron actually drowned Leonardo DiCaprio to make it look real.  Yeah, then he served the corpse to the gaffers...."  Just kidding.  But it did feel good to leave the theatre so moved by a film for a change.  <br><dd>I only had a <I>few</I> suggestions.<br><dd>If I had Cameron's ear for a few minutes, after orgasming and praising him for every film he's ever done (especially ALIENS, because you really can't get much better than that) I'd whisper a few friendly observations. First, where the hell was Steve McQueen, or George Kennedy, or Lee Marvin? Is this not the mother of all disaster films???  That has been a recent trend - disaster movies without those guys, or at least Ernest Borgnine. Second, I would have added a special scene in which Kathy Lee Gifford mistakes the Titanic for a Carnival Cruise, hops aboard and is later seen rotting in a life preserver, her bloated and frozen corpse being consumed by the scavangers of the sea in painstaking detail (we can only hope that that's in the Directors Cut).  <br><dd>I would have also added extra steamy footage of the sloppy-teenage-sex-in-a-model-t-in-a-cargo-hold scene, cut to the Doors' "Break on Through."  Sure it's an anachronism, but Jim Morrison and Jim Cameron CANNOT go wrong!<br>  <dd>Finally, there'd be a scene involving a drunken Issiac (your bartender with afro) welching on a cockfight bet in the third-class section.  He beats the shit out of Billy Zane.  Other than those minute changes, I'd leave it alone, because you can't alter perfection, and Grand Master Cameron has done it again. Oh yeah, let me just ruin the end a little and say that the fuckin' boat sinks.  Sorry, I had to.<br>  <center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images3/tourist2.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>... and quite a catch</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br></center>     </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/3/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
