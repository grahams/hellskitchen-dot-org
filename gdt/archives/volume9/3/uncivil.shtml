We'll probably need to fill out seven different forms in triplicate and submit them to the responsible authorities at least two years in advance of our approaching uncivil war.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#165;</A></a> I really think I need to start petitioning now if I want my revolution to begin before I find myself too old to clip my own toe nails. Oh, here we go: Form 9825EZ..."Application for Permit to Revolt." The estimated amount of time required to finish the paperwork is 4.25 hours, and will take up to 25 years to process. Okay, everybody meet me back here when we retire.<br><dd>Why would I want to start a revolution do you ask? Well, I don't...not off hand. You see, the disturbing thing about revolutions is that those who want most to start a revolution are the last ones who should be allowed to lead them. On top of that, the results of revolutions are almost always indistinguishable from their causes. Revolutionaries will lay down their lives, a new layer of paint, build some monuments, but their way of thinking hasn't changed. Replace the Czar with Stalin, and what has changed? Revolutions must be fought on the individual level and make people want to change the way they think. Do that, and the rest will follow. Unfortunately, I couldn't get anything like that through legislation; if I could, I would spend the rest of my days, dirty and homeless in D.C., laughing hysterically upon gazing up to the Capital's Rotunda until I go blind.<br><dd>Please understand that I'm not one of those mid-western, gun-toting, chain-smoking, boot-wearing, roast-beef-eating types intent on fenagaling large tracts of land from the federal government, proudly committing tax fraud while making immature little speeches about the rights of the people<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a> to shoot judges. They're not really revolutionaries: they just don't want to pay taxes. They want the infrastructure and any other governmental programs they use to support itself, they just don't want to have to pay for any of it. They are just like any other red-blooded American whiner. <br><dd>A lot of patriotic types are just happy enough to wrap themselves in their favorite slogan to protect them from the changing times. "America, love it or leave it!" As though this invocation of wisdom were so laden with power that it explained all of the available options. Just like any human being, this country has its faults, but it also has a great deal that is right about it. I don't have to love everything about it in order to believe in it. If I didn't care for the country, I wouldn't find myself contemplating revolution; I would simply pack up my silly string and hitch a ride on the first available air whale. The world is a big place with plenty of governments that could match my ideal. The closest to my ideal is this nation, however. Unlike the thinking of such slogan brandishers, this country was not meant to stagnate. Our constitution was supposed to grow, flourish, and change, not get twisted up in partisan squabbling.<br> <dd>Pardon my French, but who in le merd cares anymore whether Clinton had anything to do with Whitewater or if he has "distinguishing features" on his genitalia besides the special persecutor Mr. Star? For lack of the use of filibusters, the House is happy to hold investigative hearings, who's sole purpose is to make one (or more) of the other guys on the other team look worse. Closer to home, I'm sick of watching commercials heralding Alfonse Tomato as an environmental, women's, and education advocate when I know damn well that he would sell his illiterate daughter to mining concerns if she were found to be rich in minerally goodness. The varied branches of government seem to be spending more time in petty bickering amongst themselves than in actually running the federal government. Maybe it isn't entirely their fault. A standing military, without enemies, will eventually turn against itself and the people it was meant to protect. Perhaps the same can be said of lawmakers: a body of lawmakers, with nothing important to address, will endeavor to pass pettier and pettier laws to justify their jobs. Laws today are a lot like allergic reactions. Given a lack of real contagions to fight off, the body's immune system will turn against itself and attack non-contagions. As far as our government is concerned all of the big laws have already been passed, the big kids in the capital have to make it look like their still earning their wages.<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images3/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Continuing with the military paradigm, the two major parties of this nation only add to the problem of infighting and revenge legislation by creating a feeling of Us and Them. Who was the nitwit who thought up the two party system in the first place? As with most problems, I blame the Christians<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#164;</A></a> I'd like to say the Jews, but at least they believe in Good, Evil, and Not Applicable, whereas for Christianity you either Are or Are Not. Right or Wrong. White or Black. Cheese and Crackers. And in the special case of the Southern Baptists, capable of singing in key or not. We've already been given a preview for how this little excursion into the two party religious system is going to end, Armageddon, lots of war, and the occasional death or hundred billion.<br><dd> Yes, I know: there are other parties. The Bull Moose Party, Libertarians, Communists, Nazi's, the Reform Party, bla, bla, bla. But there are two main parties, and that's the point. Remember what I said about revolutions rarely changing the way people think? The Revolutionary War helped the establishment of a fairly unique governmental system for the time, but they kept the idea of the Whigs and Tories. All they did was change the names, the goals are the same. Given, no one said, "Hey, this God vs Devil idea is pretty good, why not try it in the American political system?" These things have a habit of just sort of happening, but there is nothing in the General Rule Book of Life&153; which states we are not allowed to try to change it. <br><dd>Change, however, is never easy. Things build up like hair clogs in the drain, I mean inertia, and our government has a lot of mass and has been moving along for some time now. The professional strength Draino is some time in the coming. Powering the entire juggernaut is our system of electing representatives through the electoral college ("I want to go to Bovine University"). In theory, we vote the person into office whom we feel is most likely to do our particular bidding. I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak for myself and, in this case, several of my close relations that when it comes to election time we are not voting so much to put someone into office as we are voting to keep someone out of it. When was the last time you actually voted for someone and didn't just decide upon the lesser of two evils? I know that it could mean I am just too young and idealistic, but I really feel as if I should be voting for someone for a change.<br><dd>It seems like everyone who makes it through the political system alive is either an idiot, an asshole, or an actor. The general public has taken the back seat to the political engines who can find more of what they are after by allowing themselves to be wooed by the lobbyists. Even though the lobby groups are wooing the political system, in the end the ones who get screwed are the people who make up this nation. The constitution says, "We the people..." not we the big business conglomerates. Every person in this country, age and sanity permitting, should receive a vote. Each business should receive one vote and the extent of their powers should end there. The rights of big businesses should not extend farther than the rights of the people who make them up.<br> <dd>    It doesn't take a genius to look at the political system at hand today and say that it isn't working in an efficient manner. I want a change. However with the rules of the system as they are now, making that change within the system seems an impossible dream. For now, I suppose Thoreau had the right idea with "Civil Disobedience." I will play the game for now, but as soon as it seems that the government is no longer what it aspired to be, with no hope of redemption, I will do my damnedest to-oops. Time for my medicine. See you next week!<br><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images3/1.3.gif"><br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A> I suppose the law makers thought it would be too much to expect them to wear collars and clean up their own poop too, so I left those aspects out. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#165; </A> War is never civil. Perhaps this may not have seemed to have been the case for the landed gentry of the middle ages, for whom it was considered impolite to kill. However for all others concerned, war has never been a civil affair. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons, the Gathering, and Final Fantasy, melees have never been what could be called an ordered exchange with each participant awaiting their own turn to strike and be stricken. <BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#135;</A> Well, okay.
