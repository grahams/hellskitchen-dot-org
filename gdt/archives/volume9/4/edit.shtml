The obvious exceptions are the ancient (by American standards, where 100 years is an unfathomable stretch of time) Ivy League Schools. There, tradition takes the place of active remembering.<br><dd>I've jokingly said to friends that goldfish have been bred to have memories just long enough to recall a single lap around their spherical universe. Those cursed with the skill of memory would live mind bogglingly boring lives and eventually kill themselves.<br><dd>This explains why many goldfish only survive a few days once brought home. They were adapted for aquariums larger than what they were given.For the survivors, their life is one filled with fascination and wonder. Every sight is the first. Every exploration of the sunken ship or Atlantian castle is unprecedented. To them, everything is new.<br><dd>Colleges and Universities have memories of four years.<br><dd>Students come and go, but there is little continuity. No continuation of what was. Physical objects remain to testify of the passing of ideas and dreams, but nothing essential stays. The potential sources of history, the faculty and staff, for the most part, actively choose not to get involved. Student activities are just that: student activities. With lives of their own, I suppose it's their right. And to be frank, most students do not care of what was before them. Meanwhile, students come. Students go.<br><dd>Who knows about Eisenhower College? You know, the one that apparently exploded and rained all of is books onto RIT, where they are now held captive in Wallace Memorial Library. Ask Jamie Campbell to tell you about Eisenhower College and why he wears  the gown he does at graduation ceremonies.What about WRIT? Techmalia? God only knows what else has been forgotten and recreated time and again.<br><dd>The things important now will be forgotten in four years. The award winning photography program at RIT was slain and is now nothing but words on someone's resume and overlooked pictures in ill-treated library books. The School of American Crafts and the student protests will have cold, silent kilns as their monuments.<br><dD>The School of American what?<br><dd>There are those who disbelieve. An example then: In 1991-1992, RIT's <I>Reporter Magazine</I> ran several articles critical toward the CIA's involvement with RIT and with then President Rose.<br><dd>President who?<br><dd>In 1997 <I>Reporter Magazine</I> ran several ads for the CIA to recruit students at RIT. Times change. New people take over and replace old agendas with their own, or worse, with none at all. The College's forget. Groups come. Groups go.<br><dd>I have a point, dear friend. Stay with me a bit longer. I had to talk about remembering and forgetting because I'm going to say some things that I've said before. Some will remember, most won't.<br><dd>In 1995 I talked two friends into trying to start a new, purely opinionated satire column for <I>Reporter Magazine</I>. It was rejected, so we began printing by ourselves. With luck and work (more luck than work, I think), we succeeded. Compared to how humbly we started, we downright prospered.<br>  <dd>Eventually the creator of a now gone comic, "Captain Atomic," was told by <I>Reporter Magazine</I> that there was no market for comics. So he offered his services to GDT. We sent him off to play with our sister publication, the <I>Melancholy Predator</I> (the kind-of father to <I>Melancholy Homewrecker</I>) because they needed the staff. Now, it appears that because readers complained that they didn't "get" "Hang 'Em High," it has been banish from <I>Reporter</I> and is now with us.<br><dd>I am well aware that there are detractors of <I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I> and Hell's Kitchen (there is a difference, you pithecanthracoid); those who would rather we didn't exist. I maintain that the fact we do exist is the most eloquent argument that we are necessary.<br><dd>Send us you rejected, your cast out, your lost. We are a group founded by outcasts and our operating philosophy is based on our experiences: anyone can print anything if they can defend their work to the editors.<br><dd>And if GDT were never founded, hundreds of articles, both serious and satirical never would have been written. "Captain Atomic" would have died due to missing market, the <I>Melancholy Predator</I>, <I>Melancholy Homewrecker</I>, <I>10:1 Cereal Delusions</I>, <I>Cereal</I>, and the <I>Iconoclast</I> never would have come into being. We're not being vain: simply pointing out what we've done. We are "the other" weekly publication on three colleges (yes, GDT focuses mainly on RIT, but that's only because 90% of the staff is from RIT. You can change that), founded on a rejected idea, staffed mainly by the creators of what were called second best.<br><dd>So join us. Show your support for a second source of entertainment. If you don't like what we do, then join us and change it.<br><dd>In time, we'll either disappear or new blood will take over and forget why things started. People come. People go. But I'll remember.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><IMG  SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images4/edit.gif"><br><I>Captain Atomic."
