This is nothing new or exciting, we hold election severy year. The difference is that the people we elect this year will be repsonsible for leading America into the new millennium. We have two choices: allow corporate and wealthy America and religious fundamentalists to continue to control the agenda for this country, or we can put this country back on the road to social and economic justice by electing candidates who are willing to work for the people.<br> <dd>In the December 22 issue of<I> The Nation</I>, Richard Rorty proposes a plan by which various progressive groups would unite behind a simple "People's Charter." This would give progressives something that they have been lacking - a clear-cut agenda. The Contract With (wealthy and corporate) America succeeded because it gave the right a clear-cut agenda, that the corporate media managed to obfuscate to seem appealing to the working class.<br><dd>To do this Rorty states we need to make this agenda appeal to those people who are struggling to live on the national average income of $32,000 a year. He proposes that the charter have three components, two of which I agree with.<br> <dd>The first is true campaign finance reform. This is one issue that will unite all people as both parties are guilty of taking money from interests that are hostile to the American people. The idea of candidates only being able to appear on television during free time donated by the networks in exchange for the network's broadcast rights,would be a good start for this. This would not only "level the playing field" for elections but may also allow groups to spend more money on getting out the vote.<br> <dd>It is on the second point I disagree on. Rorty proposes that this "People's Charter"support universal health insurance. This is an issue that has been tried on several occasions in this country and has been defeated every time. Instead, I propose that we base the minimum wage off the consumer price index, an idea that is called a "living wage." This would do two distinct tasks. First it would increase wages across the board, improving the starndard of living for all working men and women. The second thing it would do is provide the best form of "welfare reform" possible. By giving people jobs that will pay the bills it will get and keep them on the road to self-sufficiency.<br> <dd>The final point is some form of equalization of opportunity in schools, and I don't think Rorty is talking about vouchers. Unfortunately, Rorty does not propse any specific plan for this. That would be something that the groups' would have to work out themselves.<br> <dd>But an agenda is not enough. These ideas need to be put into action, that is where the idea of "The People's Challenge" comes in.<br>  <dd>This "Challenge"would be made by the leadership of the groups that decide to make up and sign the Charter. It would consist of three components:<br> <dd>The first is selection of candidates. After the May primaries, the "People's Charter" groups would find out what candidates support the agenda contained in the Charter. They would then see which of these canadiates are incumbents who are threatened by right-wing candidates and those that are running against venerable conservatives, these two types of candidates would be the ones that get the most support, other candidates would get support, but not to the same extent. It's the idea of protect what we have and try to take out weak links.<br>  <dd>The second is a two-fisted attack. The first component is to educate voters on these issues in the Charter and how it affects them personally. Focusing on the massive inequalities in the country; how despite our economy is rising that we possess the greatest maldistribution of wealth in the industrialized world, that at minimum wage a person is still 20% below the poverty line,and other issues of that nature. The second stage is to present the Charter to these voters, let them look at it, discuss it, and maybe even ammend it. It is a "People's Charter", so shouldn't the people have a say in it?<br><dd>The final component is to register and involve voters in the process of electing these candidates. This is another advantage the right has; they can mobilize more quickly. While in New Hampshire, I watched that as election day drew closer and the conservative candidates were in further jeopardy that the two groups that make up the core of the right, the NRA and the Christian Coalition, began to pump out a steady stream of ads. It worked. We progressives need to do the same thing, this "People's Charter" would allow such an opportunity, as the groups that make it up could possibly pool both money and human resources.<br>  <dd>I admit this idea would be extremely difficult to implement, but I feel that it is something that must be done!<br>    <table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><B><I>Visit www.rit.edu/~jld2705/enunciator/<br>enunciator_home.html for more material from The Enunciator.
