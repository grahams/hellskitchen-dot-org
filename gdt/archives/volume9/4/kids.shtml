Good job. With the all superficial, transient news that is passed off on Americans, I'm impressed that you could remember. For those troglodytes out there going, "Huh?" let me fire those synapses. A few months ago the moon-faced Limy Louise Woodward, alias <I>au pair</I>,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#135;</A></a> was tried for murder.<br><dd>Not to dredge up old news, but lets dredge up old news and put it under the specially polarized lights of GDT.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a> In case you didn't hear, the baby's parents were both medical doctors; one at Brigham & Womens', the other at the Children's Hospital, yet they failed to notice their son's broken wrist and 6.4cm skull fracture for at least two weeks. I suppose that it's understandable. Both parents had the Puritan work ethic. It was revealed in court that the parents were too occupied in the morning to change the baby's diapers before the <I>au pair</I> arrived, so he lay in his crib, unchanged, bones broken, while the parents rushed off to work where they were paid good money to care for other peoples' children. When they got home, they were too tired, etc....<br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images4/1.1.gif"><br><dd>I could go on and on, but instead, I'm more interested in why these people had a baby in the first place. They certainly didn't want to spend time with it, that's for sure.<br> <dd>Of course we, as biologic entities, are driven to reproduce. "It's not my fault, officer! My damn selfish genes made me do it!" This has a kernel of truth to it, but I thought parents were genetically hard wired to care for and protect their offspring. It's that whole big-eyed, small-chinned, full-lipped, symmetric-face look that makes college geeks jack off over Anime photos, and makes Daddies say, "Uh, I've got to use the bathroom," after seeing his daughter in a swim suit. Something must have gone wrong with the culture to be able to override our desire to cuddle and protect babies.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#131;</A></a> As an example, the crane has a circuit in her lower brain that triggers a reflexive egg-nudging action at the sight of a sufficiently egg-shaped object rolling on the ground. She will nudge the egg back into the nest, or go crazy trying. Really. If you nail an egg shaped piece of wood to the floor, that stupid bird will get so frustrated that it will conscientiously pluck all its feathers out in a great preening frenzy. If she left her eggs with an <I>au pair</I> and they were cracked when she got back, you bet she'd notice. And would there be birdy hell to pay. I suppose we can't expect such silliness from a human, however. We're a very busy species.<br><dd>"But wait," you cry out, indignant and frankly a little tired of our pretentiousness. "People have children because they love children." Maybe, but if you love your children, you sacrifice some of your career or social life to spend time with your kids (or if you have no work or social life, you don't stay out boozing all night). Take a bus sometime - watch how parents treat their children. If they're yelling at and threatening their kids on the bus, pulling their arms into unnatural angles, grabbing hair, or cleaning their faces with spit, imagine what happens at home. Love is a beautiful thing to see...and I don't see love when a parent is dragging a crying child to the daycare center where they're afraid of being laughed at. Then you've got the parents who toss the newborn into a plastic bag and throw him out with the garbage (we're horrified by this, but it's just a home-style abortion. The only difference is the hospital burns their babies instead of throwing them out. Which would you say is more earth friendly? Tough call. Between filling landfills and polluting the air, I'd say the two just about break even). Love is in the air. I can smell it.<br><IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images4/1.2.gif"><br><dd>Money is the fuel driving our culture. It is the cause and the end of everything we do, so it's no surprise that economics plays such a major role in childrearing. In The New Generation, Bertrand Russell wrote:<br><dd>"The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a small one - particularly if he plays golf, which he usually does [or in the urban case, if he skips town when the kids are still infants and leaves the mother trying to attract men to help support her].<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a> It is a little difficult to see what he is purchasing when he pays for his children, and but for tradition it may be doubted whether he would consider children a good bargain."<br><dd>Contrary to the tax <I>on</I> children that GDT proposed last year, the socialists<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#181;</A></a> (Hey! That's "Democrats" to you, buddy.) have set it up so the more puppies you squirt out, the more money you get from Uncle Sam (and you get a bonus if you don't work). At the same time, the government is spending money trying to reduce urban crowding and child abandonment (how far are we from FBI Norplant&#153; sorties into inner-city housing developments? "Roger, Red Squirrel. We've got a breeder on our flank. Requesting authorization to engage. Over"). It's a two-edged sword: "Have kids? You need money." "You need money? Have kids." Once you've got them, you can abandon them: it's your name on the check, that money is for you. Go out, buy a big screen TV or a few magic 8-balls-you deserve it. Just make sure you pick up some Doritos and Pepsi on the way home so the kids have dinner.<br><dd>The underprivileged are egregious because they're more of a financial drain, but it's unfair of me to pick on just them. Foofie parents (like those in the Louise Woodward case) act the same, but they can hire nannies. Fly to France for the weekend or simply work all day, too tired to read a story when you get home. Where does it end? Nannies, VCRs,<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#167;</A></a> baby gyms, child therapists, $3200 a week soccer camps, finishing school, $28,000 a year universities that babysit your children - anything so the parents don't have to get their hands dirty. Then when the parents are old and decrepit, the kids will toss them into a nursing home and sell the house. Can't really blame them. <br><dD>If you love children, then by all means have one. Better yet, get them from someone who doesn't want theirs. On the otherhand, if you just want to make money by having kids, follow my simple formula: <br><table><tr><td valign = top width = 5></td><td valign = top><B>1.)</B> Charge money for someone to impregnate the mother (if you are the mother and you are a butt-ugly-girl and your breath smells like ass, pay someone to impregnate you. Don't worry, you'll make it  back. No, it's not prostitution. You're doing it for love...love of money). If you can, get the guy to marry the mother.<br><B> 2.)</B> When the kid is born, divorce the father. Get the house, the car, child support and alimony. Then sell the house.<br> <B>3.)</B> Now you're homeless and you can collect welfare and unemployment. Sell the food stamps to someone who needs food.<br> <B>4)</B> Sell the baby into the sex slave market in Greenland.<br> </td></tr></table><dd>As a typical American, you're probably more familiar with the Asian Sex Market&#153;, so here's some advice: put the kid in a barrel and feed him green oatmeal through a hole until he's 18. Then sell him to a circus as a green hunchbacked midget (not to be confused with the fleshy monopods being circulated on the blackmarket pinata circuit). With all those rolls of flesh, you may have to put baby powder on them to help cut down on the chaffing as they move, but think of the number of people they can service at once. Hurray!<br><dd>If you're driven biologically to reproduce, try masturbation. I knew a guy who got his cat off with a pencil when she was in heat, just to shut her up and keep her from clawing the couch to shit. If masturbation doesn't work, I'll give you the guy's address... see what he can do for you.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"><A NAME="7"></A></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A>Kids care of <I>Melancholy Homewrecker's</I> "Big Daddy's Biology Show." Gosh you kids are smart. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#135; </A> Louise Woodward belongs to the once infamous Babyrattler Gang. In the early twenties the Babbyrattlers were best known for smuggling large quantities of hooch across state lines in millions of sanitary baby bottles protectively wrapped in individual Woobies. Elliot Ness and his Untouchables were primed to turn their attention to the Babbyrattlers just after they brought in Al Capone for tax evasion, but alas it was to late, because prohibition was revoked and the motherly Babyrattler Gang, with such notables as Joey the Diaper, the Passifier, and Tickle Me Elmo, got off scott free. Over the years, the gang declined in their infamy (huh?) and slowly became a legitimate racket peddling their babysitting knowhow across the globe. It's only in Asia that they have had a return to glory, selling difficult children into whatever market needs pre-pubescent, succulent, sexed up, Asian children. For the life of me, I can't think of what you'd use them for, but recently the chicken market has ordered more than their usual half dozen. <BR><A HREF="#3.3">&#164;</A> Unbeknownst to most physicists, the "Dark Matter" that has been theorized is nothing but subatomic particles of absurdity. Of course they haven't been detected because when an absurdity particle collides with a detector, an unbelievable reading is given. The scientists look at the data and say, "That's absurd," and chalks up the weird readings to experimental error. Anyway, after three years of work, using a mint Commodore 64, an old oscilloscope, a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses, and an Energizer nine-volt battery (we tried other batteries, but only Energizers work. We think it has something to do with that rabbit and the unusually high concentration of absurdity around it), GDT has discovered that absurdity is polarized. By donning the modified Ray-Bans and watching CNN Headline News, normally serious news is filtered out and only the absurdity comes through. Quite refreshing, really. The only problem is the splitting headaches you get from keeping the nine-volt pressed up against your tongue for too long.<BR><A HREF="#4.4">&#131;</A> Except in the case when a single mother lands a husband. Males are hardwired to want to pass on their genes, so any child already existing is a threat to their deoxywhatchamacallits. Kill the bastard (no, really) and there are more available resources for an updated child carrying the new husband's genes. Don't like the sound of that? Then why are there more incidents of step father's beating the living beejesus (as opposed to the deceased beejesus that falls off of you and comprises about 95% of your household dust) out of them and killing their wive's children? This doesn't mean that every man will commit infanticide...it just means they're generally bastards.<BR><A HREF="#5.5">&#165;</A>See &#131;<BR><A HREF="#6.6">&#181;</A> Bertrand Russell was a socialist while it was fashionable. He came to his senses.<BR><A HREF="#7.7">&#167;</A> The hoopla raised by people over the need for TV ratings is directly connected to people's use of TV as a baby sitter...or <I>au pair</I>, as the case may be. If there were no ratings, parents would be forced to pay attention to what their children are watching, if not their children. Kudos to NBC for not giving a shit.<BR> </td></tr></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/cl.html">Chad Loder</A><br><dd>	<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sa.html">Steve Antonson</A><br><dd>	<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd>	<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><p></td></tr></table><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
