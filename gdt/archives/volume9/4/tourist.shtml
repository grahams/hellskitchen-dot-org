Do you have a spare 34 hour time block to kill?  Do you want to be seriously fucked up for the rest of your days?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, do I have the opportune solution for you.  Get a bunch of friends together, along with a projection screen TV, 40 dollars worth of doughnuts, 7 pizzas, about ten gallons of black coffee, and watch back to back episodes of David Lynch's (aka Holy God of "What the fuck was that?") <I>Twin Peaks</I>.  That's what I did this weekend, and boy am I glad that I did!  Acid? Mushrooms? Peyote? Naaahhhhhh.  That's some lightweight shit compared to the experience that unfolds when you combine the vision of a beautifully demented writer/director with a passive journey into the world of sleep deprivation.  Fans know exactly what I'm talking about. Others may scoff at the TV series, which aired in the early 90's and recently on Bravo, but I must give it the Tourist Seal of Approval&#153;.  If you decide to do this, however, there are several helpful points that you may want to be aware of.<br> <dd><B>1. Time has no meaning.</B>  I mean that.  The hours will fly by like you're in the womb again, and the last episode is as shocking as being born, so boil some water.<br> <dd><B>2. Remember ass? </B> I mentioned it in my Copland review a while back.  If you don't make sure that you are master of your bodily funk (34 hours without shower, remember) the funk will take over.  You'll be sitting on the couch, and your funk will go get doughnuts and coffee for your friend's funk.  Most of us are not as adept as George Clinton at wrangling the funk (they don't call him the funkmaster for nothing - last year, when he came to Rochester, he wore nothing but some Levi's  and a Lion King bedsheet.  His armpit stains resembled the Valdez oil spill, yet I smelled nothing, and I was in the front row!) so be sure to use some Dial.<br> <dd><B>3. You won't get it. </B> That's normal.  In order to assume proper David Lynch movie watching position, lean forward on your seat.  Look intently at the screen and contort your face to resemble the expression it gets when you think, "Mercy Christmas!  Was I just sodomized by a leper."  Now keep that expression on your face and scream in fear and confusion when appropriate.<br> <dd><B>4. Sleep deprivation causes hallucinations. </B> That is also normal.  And couple that with <I>Twin Peaks</I> stimuli, and you have a recipe that would kick Timothy Leary's ass.  At one point in time, I saw Tallulah Bankhead swing down on a large, knotted rope, naked and quaffing a bottle of Old Grand Dad, screaming at the top of her lungs "HAVE YOU GOT A CHESTERFIELD, DAAAAAAAHHHLING?????"  All I had was a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, but that was good enough.  She took them and climbed back into the coffee machine where she belonged.  All was good. <br><center><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images4/tourist2.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>"The Tourist Seal of Approval"&#153;</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br></center>     <dd><B>5. Finger snapping is reserved for only certain parts.</B>  Yes, I know that a lot of the music has snaps in it, but audience members should only snap when Coop (Special Agent Dale Cooper) is doing something really cool, or Audrey Horne (little prick tease that she is) is doing something really naughty with her tongue.  All other snapping is considered extraneous and rude.<br> <dD><B>6. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery after viewing the final episode. </B> Pregnant women should consult a physician about partaking in such a viewing marathon, for it has been know to produce strange birth defects and problem discharge. (Just covering my ass, don't want no nasty law suits!) That's about all.  Have fun, eat and drink, be merry.<br>  <dd>Lynch has made many movies, and all of them will mess you up.  But when you watch all the <I>Twin Peaks</I> at once, you realize that it is no TV show.  Try a 34 hour epic clusterfuck cinema experience that will blow your mind, and make you look at the world with a Batman-villain's-secret-hideout camera angle. Slanted, and all kinds of crazy-whack! <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/4/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
