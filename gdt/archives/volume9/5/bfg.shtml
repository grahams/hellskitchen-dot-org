W<FONT SIZE =-1>HAT HAPPENED TO THEM?<DD>- HUMAN BEING OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN</font size><p>Dear human being of unknown origin,<br><dd>I'm glad you asked me that question. For a thorough answer to this question, I must look to art history. In the Renaissance there was an artist who had painted a most extraordinary nude. She lounges with her back to her appreciating audience. Many of this master painter's contemporary critics assailed the poor painter for "adding an extra vertebra" to the model so he could over develop the curvature of her spine as she sat in repose. The artist fiercely defended his work and the artistic rendering of his subject. The fact was that the model actually appeared exactly as her figure had been molded. She indeed had what would be termed by most, an extra vertebra. But how?<br><dd>The answer to this question lies in the miracle of birth, or rather the quirky behaviors of the midwife, or medical staff present at the time of birth. At the time of birth, infants are rubbery and malleable (for anyone interested in flat foreheads, oblong skulls, feet tiny enough to fit into a thimble, and freaky Akhenaton physical features, it is best to mold your children when still young and pliable, not only for the play-do&trade; factor involved, but for the fact that they won't remember it when they get older). They have a sort of rubbery cohesion at work, bits of them attach strangely to other bits.<br> <dd>Take the umbilical cord for instance. It has a strange stringy connection to a particular vertebra. When doctors detach the umbilical cord, they ultimately give the cord a minute little tug as they tie it in a knot prior to the procedure of cutting. This tug, while infinitesimal by our standards today is just enough to pull that soft little bone out of position and somewhere into the abdomen. Now if the doctor performing the cutting procedure is of that strange and rare type who always needs the help of another person's finger to hold the knot in place before its perfect execution, then the minute amount of pressure applied by the assisting finger is just enough force to poke that vertebra right back into position. Thus a long necked person is born. Otherwise the dislodged bone floats around the body aimlessly until its component parts are broken down and used for other necessary functions of the body.<br><dd>In the case of a no-neck person, often what occurs is that shortly after birth the child while finding themselves in a gassy position is burped a little over-enthusiastically by some proud parent. Those little love taps on the back, performed to dislodge sticky bubbles of air from the throat and esophagus, when continually hitting the exact same place on the child end up displacing yet another soft vertebra.<br><dd>In a special case of infant morphing, a distinguished African tribe well known for wearing spectacular gold bands around their throats and stretching their necks to outrageous proportions, often soaks the infant child's throat in vinegar for up to a week after birth. The vinegar, once absorbed through the skin, eventually makes it's way to the youthful bone tissue and makes the bones themselves more responsive to future acts of stretching and bending. The only severe side effect of this treatment is that the young mother must show extra care in supporting both the head and the neck, or else the neck is liable to continue bending all the way back, and then continue on in any manner gravity pleases. On the up side, the infant child could beat the world's record for longest neck if you just hung them upside down by their legs for a twenty-four hour period (for a more dramatic effect, swing them side to side like a pendulum. NOTE: after an hour or so of such vigorous activity you may have to go in search of some object on which to stand if you want to continue with the festivities).<br><dd>-the Bare-foot Girl<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/5/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/bfg.html"> Other Bare-foot Girl Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
