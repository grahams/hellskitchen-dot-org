In the three years we've been doing this, GDT (and by extension, the Rochester branch of Hell's Kitchen) has been late a total of three times including last week. When we started doing this, one of the founding principles was that we print weekly, on time, no matter what. Well, we blew it. Last week, issues didn't start to trickle out until Tuesday.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> As I write this, I sit in a room with somewhere around 300 issues waiting to go to RIT's Science Building and the University of Rochester.<br> <dd>Anyway, I wanted to share just what an amazingly screwy week it was. It was as though we were at the nexus of all the multiverse's crappy feelings and ill-will.<br> <dd>It started innocently enough: our illustrator for that week, Matt Messner, never got illustrations to us. At the time we didn't know it, but Matt simply didn't check his email and thus never received the draft of our issue. Pain in the ass, but it happens; it just means he wouldn't get paid that week and we'd have a little extra cash.<br><dd>The next bit of trouble was when we didn't hear from the Melancholy Homewrecker. This will probably only be interesting to those of you who wondered how Hell's Kitchen works: when each member is done with their issue, they electronically send it to Hell's Kitchen. Well, we called the editrix of the Melancholy Homewrecker and discovered that she <I>had</I> sent the file. It just never arrived. It disappeared into that mysterious electronic purgatory of lost messages. She had to stick it onto disk and bring it over the Hell House. Fine. Small matter taken care of, but it really was an omen of things to come.<br><dd>I procrastinate. Ask Kelly.<br> <dd>"Hey Kelly."<br><dd>"Hmmm?"<br><dd>"Do I procrastinate?"<br><dd>"Do you procrastinate? Yes. If you didn't procrastinate you wouldn't be writing this now."<br><dd>See?<br><dd>I was tired on Wednesday and just wanted to go to bed. On Thursday, I arrived home from work around 10pm after a 13 hour day and started on layout for GDT. Thankfully Josh French had already finished the Hell's Kitchen cover, else my night might have been worse. Bleary-eyed and exhausted, I finished layout at 4:30am. Stretching, I connected to the Internet and began uploading all of the associated Hell's Kitchen files for later download. I stumbled up the stairs, set my alarm for 6:30am, and passed out.<br><dd>Unfortunately, my alarm never went off.<br><dd>Waking by myself at 7, I got up, got out of bed, ran a comb across my head, and boogied down to the computer to make sure everything had uploaded correctly during my nap. Apparently, as soon as I had turned my back on the computer to go to bed a few hours before, RIT's system kicked me off. So I immediately logged back on and tried again. And was dumped. And connected. And was dumped.<br><dd>Ok. Time was definitely an issue at this point. We get our work done at the University of Rochester's Copy Center. There, Carol and the rest of the staff do their best for us. Really. They're great. There was one time when 700 issues just disappeared, and they stopped work on all other orders to redo us. Anyway, they like 2 days to get the job done, but I hoped they would be able to finish it in one, as they aren't open on the weekend.<br><dd>Frazzled, I quickly found four disks. Two became PC disks (huzzah!) and I was able to fit the Homewrecker and the Hell's Kitchen cover pages onto them. The GDT file posed some problems, however. It was 2.1 meg and even compressed would not fit onto a single floppy. Doing the only thing I could think of, I segmented to file onto two disks using CompactPro (for those following along at home, CompactPro is a Macintosh compression program). Done, I went to get the money for printing that week and discovered Tom (actually, it's Tom's Head. We keep the Hell's Kitchen petty cash in the same kind of gum-ball machine MST3K uses for Tom Servo's head. Little trivia for ya) was a little light that week. I grabbed cash from my room, rushed out to my car, came back in, put on shoes, and I was gone.<br><dd>Once I got to work, I dumped my stuff at my desk and quaboppled to the graduate room. There, they have the most neurotic Macintosh I've ever seen. Macs are supposed to be fairly sturdy as far as their operating system, but this bastard had so many weird, conflicting extensions and control panels on it that half the time it wouldn't even get past the Happy Mac pict. Luckily, it had just been reconfigured by a minimalist, so it had the bare bones system software and worked fine. The plan was to desegment GDT and upload it onto the 'net so I could download it to a PC and print it out. I inserted the disk that had the last segment of the GDT file (because CompactPro likes to start with the last bit), and double clicked.<br><dd>The computer didn't have CompactPro installed. Sigh. I hopped on the 'net and did a quick search for downloadable versions of CompactPro. Without paying too much attention, I downloaded the first one (the only one) I found.<br> <dd>It was in Dutch.<br><dd>I couldn't read a thing. That's ok, though: I'd used the software enough to know where to click without being able to read it. Things are going fine until, oops! Disk error. The entire file was fucked.<br><dd>It just turned 9am at this point. My day could only improve.<br><dd>In a silent fury, I returned to my desk and began to print the Homewrecker and the HK cover from disk. While they were coming off, I called Josh.<br><dd>Josh is one of the brave souls who is planning on taking over GDT once Kelly and I disappear into the sunset to work on various other projects and books that we've put on hold. Well, Josh knew the drill as far as uploading files: things like this had happened before, just not on this scale. He tried, and tried, and tried. And around 11:30 it was finally uploaded. Immediately I printed it off and dashed for the copy center. Ignoring the front desk, I went straight to the people who do the jobs and asked them if they could do half the job by 4:30 that day.<br><dd>Come to find out, the copier they use, a brand new Xerox Docutech&#153;, was acting up. Their other copier was being cleaned and they were backed up in orders. They might be able to get it for us on Tuesday. It was at this point that I understood that the multiverse was out to get GDT. Paranoid schizophrenia be damned! Too much was going wrong to be coincidence. Well, I've never been one to sit by and let powers larger than me push me around (I'm short. When you're short, you get used to pushing big things when they push you. Everything is big).<br><dd>I called Josh again and explained to situation. Luckily, he had done some research into area copy places and found one that would do the job for the same cost as the UofR. We agreed to meet at an entrance at 1:30pm. By 2:15, when he still hadn't showed up, I went back to work. Come to find out, Josh's car wouldn't start. In fact, it's still sitting in the driveway and I have a feeling that once all the issues go out, it will start as though the thought of not starting had never entered its ferric head. Josh wandered around until he found me and by 2:30 he was on his way to the new copy place, originals in hand, cash in pocket, and proof of what the UofR charged us, uh, in other hand. He drove with his knees.<br><dd>Once he got there, it was disclosed he would have to make new originals. Unlike UofR, the new place needed the originals to be on legal size paper. Once Josh had done this, the owner nervously asked when we needed the order done by. As soon as Josh walked in the door, his copier broke down. The originals were left there with the hope they'd be done by 5pm the next day (Saturday). Well, 5pm came and went. No issues. The copy machine was erratic and needed repair. To their credit, they said they'd work on the order on Sunday in an attempt to get the job done. Sunday came. Sunday went. No issues. Try Monday.<br><dd>By this time I was having nightmares about the issues. In them, they looked like <I>Raygun</I> but had the content of <I>Reporter</I>. I woke up screaming.<br><dd>Monday came and at 4pm we were told that the copier was simply not going to be able to finish. They gave us a complete refund, but it was too late to get them to the UofR copy center that day. The first thing the next day I dropped off the originals at the UofR and everything was set. Half were picked up Tuesday afternoon, the rest Wednesday.<br><dd>That was our week. And we're doing it again, even as I write this.
