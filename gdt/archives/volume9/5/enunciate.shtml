For it was 25 years ago that the Supreme Count determined that a woman has the right to chose to abort her unborn child. The decision ushered a new era in the rights of women, and created one of the most divisive issues of this century. Those who oppose the right to chose, along with their allies on the Religious Right have made several assaults on this right to chose in the courts and all have been blunted.  An article in Rochester New York's City magazine recounts these legal assaults and how they have been stopped by the high court; Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth, a 1976 decision, nullified the need for spousal consent, the 1979 Bellotti vs. Barid decision voided the need for a teenager to get consent from both parents, and in both the 1983 case of City of Akron vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health and the 1986 Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians, the court stuck down various other restrictions.<br><dd>But while the right to chose is there-the accessibility isn't. Kathy Quinn Thomas of the Rochester NY chapter of NOW (National Organization for Women), says that the anti-abortion movement is wearing away at the right to choose "by sandpaper, a little here, a little there. One area these forces have won victories is in the area of financing abortions. The City article reports  how in 1977 the Supreme Court upheld bans on the use of public funds for "medically unnecessary" abortions. During the 1980's, when the Religious Right hit it's peak, was when the attacks got more powerful. The 1980 Harris vs. McRae decision upheld the Hyde amendment, denying public funds for all abortions except those case of rape or incest, 1989 brought the Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services case, denying public facilities the right to perform abortions.  1989 brought a great step backwards, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern PA vs. Casey , the court, now loaded with Republican (and Religious Right backed) anti-choice judges, upheld a 24 hour waiting period.<br><dd>With the election of President Clinton in 1992, there have been some small steps  forward. But the rise of the Right in congress has put the right to choose under legislative attack.  In 1997 alone a ban on the use of public funding to international family planning services that provide abortions, a ban on even privately funded abortions on military bases, bans allowing employees to chose health care plans that provide for coverage of abortions and an extension of the Hyde Amendment, to include Medicaid managed care plans.  It looks like the words of the rap group Diggable Planets may be truer than we think" they want to make it a privilege, not a right, accessible only to the rich."<br> <dd>Another obstacle to the right to chose is lack of access.  The campaign of intimidation waged by the anti-choice movement has left 84% of US counties without identifiable providers, according to the Alan Guttmacher institute and only in first term.<br><dd>Alternatives exist, the drug RU-486 which has a US patent--thanks to the Population Council, a non-profit group, is one.  The Group simply cannot find a company to produce it.  And a new procedure that allows for an abortion to be done while in child is nothing more than a mass of cells the size of a match head. Of course the anti-abortionists, who believe that life begins at the moment of conception even oppose this procedure.  Of course to many it's life changes at the moment of birth.  If the mother is of sufficient income, the child becomes a new life, but if the mother is poor or unwed, the child becomes, in many cases a "welfare leech."  I would have a bit more credence for the anti-abortion movement if they would work harder for such things as more accessible child care, better health services for poor mothers, and even a minimum wage that would allow a person to stay above the poverty line.<br><dd>Roe vs. Wade will never be overturned, at least not in one fell swoop.  It will be chipped away at until nothing is left.  Unless the forces of choice can mass together and perhaps unite with other groups to repel it!<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><B><I>Visit www.rit.edu/~jld2705/enunciator/<br>enunciator_home.html for more material from The Enunciator.
