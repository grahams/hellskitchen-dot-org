As many had predicted, "Seinfeld" was going to end its run on NBC.<br><dd>The show seemed to have no premise to it. The adventures of a stand-up comic, a woman who was more than slightly neurotic, an overweight, blad character who never seemed to be able to hold down a job for more than a few months at a time, and  a world-class moocher, all going through the trials and tribulations of life in New York City. Many people said the show was about "nothing."<br><dd>But it was about something, you can't make a show about nothing. "Seinfeld" took a comic look at simple events of everyday life in a big city; riding the subway, going to the mall, interviewing for a job, writing for a table at a restaurant. It also looked at some of our culture's taboos; masturbation, homosexuality, bulimia, and cast a humorous light on them, and as jerry Seinfeld himself said, "Not that there's anything wrong with that!"  The show was a "situation comedy" distilled to its purest form.<br><dd>The characters were as much fun as the situations. Kramer, with his never-ending tics and gestures. Elaine, seeming to stumble through life in a way that seemed organized. George, the likable loser, with his squabbling parents and never ending search for the two things that all men really want, a woman and a good job. Jerry, with his apartment full of uneaten cereal, an unridden bike, and  a computer that has never been turned on. Each half-hour concerned these four different people, and an occasional appearance by an annoying postman, all dealing with a problem that somehow touches all of them.<br><dd>The show also took a look at New York City itself, with its own distinct feel, sound and attitude! The show was full of references to places, many of them real, among them the infamous "Soup Nazi." The characters helped with the New York Marathon, went to New York Yankees and New Jersey Devils games (never did much with football or basketball, though). This was a violation of a TV convention that states you shouldn't put so many references about a city in a show, at least not a sitcom!<br><dd>The show did spawn imitators. Make the characters younger and you have "Friends." Move the show to another coast and you had "Ellen" (formerly "These Friends of Mine"). It added phrases to our language; "Master of your domain," "No soup for you," and various kinds of "Talkers" ("Close Talkers," "Low Talkers," etc.). It made a group of virtually unknown actors household names, and made you laugh and then thin afterward.<br><dd>I'm going to miss "Seinfeld," this may be one show that can never be equalled!<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/5/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/jd.html">James D'Angelo</A> <br> </html>
