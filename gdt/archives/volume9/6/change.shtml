The Bible says that love of money is the source of evil (actually it's the love of evil that's the source of money. Ironic, ain't it?), but as far as I can see, the lack of money is the source of much of people's dissatisfaction. Those with heaps of cash are rarely seen worrying about how they are going to meet their next student loan payment or, at an even more basic level, whether they can afford caviar. But they never have to worry about whether they will have enough money to buy food.<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> After all, food is what other people eat. The closest they have had to a bad night's sleep is when they wonder whether all the arrangements have been made with the caterer for their daughter's debutante ball.<br> <IMG  width = 350 align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Conversely, those who are living in poverty are fairly cheery. They may live in squalor, they may be looked down upon, but (at least outside of urban areas) they, their wife, and their 48 children are hardened, proud people who, when faced with the thought of where their next meal is coming from, go out into the yard and kill a 12-gauge or load their chicken and go hunting.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#164;</A></a><br><dd>It is in the Middle Class that misery from money is most evident. Evolving from the traders and merchants of the Middle Ages, today's middle class is (pardon me if I sound like Engels and/or Marx),<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#135;</A></a> little more than a glorified serf. Capitalism is a feudal system, with the Lords (CEOs) at the top of the pyramid and all his vassals under him...and in the some instances, this last statement is to be taken literally when referring you attractive vassals. I'm not saying this is good or bad; I'm just tellin ya the way I see it.<br> <dd>Anyway, money itself is a curious thing, if you think about it. Barter is easy to understand: I think that my horse is worth 1614 tomatoes, so we make a fair trade. But money is neat. Believed to have been invented somewhere on the Anatolian Plateau in what is now modern Turkey, someone said, "Hey! That metal is really rare. I'll trade you 1614 rabid, headless roosters<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#165;</A></a> for it." Eventually, people started weighing the pieces of metal, and standards were made. A seven klog piece of gold was worth the same as a horse. That's all fine and good, but all those klogs got heavy.<br> <dd>Eventually, someone with thick walls and a lot of friends with weapons said, "I'll just keep all your gold here and give you these light pieces of copper that say what they're worth. If they don't believe you, tell'um to come see me and my boys. If you don't believe me, me and my boys will come and see you." In that moment, banking and the Mafia were born.<br> <dd>So, thanks to those long forgotten clever chaps, we carry around discs of metal or paper, which isn't inherently worth anything. Yet, we all agree that a given pile of metal of differing size and composition represents one dollar of gold...almost. Our economic system - and as far as I know, every modern economic system<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#131;</A></a> is based on the gold standard. Periodically, there are those who call for a change. Here in the United States, a popular alternative is the silver standard. A platinum standard has been tossed around, but rejected. In some regions in Latin America they still kick around the Coca standard. Few areas seriously consider salt anymore, so gold is still king. <br><IMG  align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/1.2.gif"><br><dd>But gold isn't really that rare, and has no built in safeguards to control ones accumulation of it. Not so with plutonium. Isolated in 1940 by the bright boys working on the atomic bomb, plutonium239 is some of the rarest and most powerful stuff on earth. Why shouldn't it be our basis for cash?<br> <dd>Starting in 2005, the Treasury Department and the Department of Defense will issue several thousand "dollars" worth of the new plutonium based currency. As a special treat in this first, highly historic issuing, they plan on doing away with the whole concept of money and issue the real stuff: thousands of kilograms of weapons grade plutonium.<br> <dd>Referred to as Pluti after the Greek God Plutus, son of Demeter (Hey! This is starting to feel like a show by James Burke. Kick Ass!), and the personification of wealth, the first issuing will have the standard graven images on both sides of the small, and oddly warm coins (if your money is warm, that means it loves you<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#167;</A></a>). On one side will be the familiar "pyramid with an eye", symbolizing Trinity, Little Boy, and Fat Man where the all seeing eye is the unused fourth bomb produced. The glory about the eye is the atomic fireball itself. Of course the inscription Novus Ordo Seclorum remains, because that's exactly what the Trinity project brought about: a new world order. On the flip side will be the scientists and leaders who brought us the power of the atom: Albert Einstein (1 plutus), Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman (2 pluti), General Leslie Groves (5 pluti), Enrico Fermi (10 pluti featuring a backdrop of the University of Chicago's squash court), Emperor Hirohito (25 pluti) and of course Robert Oppenheimer (50 pluti-the largest denomination), just to name a few.<br> <dd>Weighing approximately 100g, the Eini, as we're sure it will be called, is the smallest unit. The largest, the Oppenheimer, is also the rarest. Featuring a unique departure from the rest of the coins in that it lacks the pyramid on the back, it has the gaunt, tortured face of Robert Oppenheimer on one side and a depiction of the many armed Siva on the other. In addition to the Novus Ordo inscription, the side having Oppenheimer's likeness will proudly read Perditor Mundorum. Unfortunately, the Oppenheimer is over 5kg and tends make big holes when exposed to most anything.<br> <dd>Given the inherent danger and physical properties of pluti, the mass of any given denomination will decrease over time, thereby decreasing its value.  Similar to Twinkies. and soda, pluti will have a discrete "Best if used by" stamped onto their surface allowing the holder to know how long they have to use their currency. It will be a society spending as much pluti as quickly possible. Our standard of living will dwarf that of other countries. And all thanks to radiation...thanks Madam Curie.<br><dd>To deal with the unfortunate quality that the money tends to explode when more than 50 pluti are in one place, banks will become like nuclear reactors. There, within their lead lined walls where surveillance cameras watch all who come and go (the eye!), bank tellers will don their lead lined clothing, put on their radiation badge, and count out their customers' money, knowing that a miscount could result is a pile of change that has reached critical mass and ruined their last chances for a promotion.<br> <dd>And talk about having your money work for you!  Interest on your money will be determined by how much energy your monies can supply while they're used for fuel to super-heat water and run turbines. Actually this will result in a loop hole for the banks/reactors to squeeze a few more pluti out of you and your pile: since they will undoubtedly become the cheapest source of energy around, you will, in effect, be giving the bank back part of your interest each month with your electric bill payment.<br> <dd>Already Nike has begun designing clothing specially adapted for use with radioactive currency. Lined with a thin, comfortable layer of lead, the company plans on promoting the attire not only as an aid in exercise, but being safe, under the motto "Just In Case."<br> <IMG  align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Of course giving out a virtually unlimited amount of weapons grade plutonium to the general public could be seen as a threat, but that is a stance only taken by the same mamby-pamby liberals who think hand guns and automatic weapons should be banned. The Treasury Department, taking council from the NRA, has taken the stance that there will be no nuclear threat if everyone has weapon grade plutonium. I concur. Once everyone has the ability to blow up a chunk of firmament and it's occupants, society will start taking care of the bad apples in the barrel. The whole world will become a better, safer place. Besides, using a nuclear weapon on an enemy under the plutonium money system would be like making bullets out of gold today. It would be absurd to think about wasting all that wealth!<br> <dd>Removal of large scale nuclear threats does not mean that unwitting individuals won't become threats to themselves and others. Example: I tend to horde change. It's a habit I picked up from my father. He would come home after being away on a construction job for months, and have a suitcase full of the jingly-gangly stuff. I remember helping him and my mother roll over $100 in loose change one time. Over time my family has gotten increasingly more advanced in its change hoarding in that they now use a large water-cooler container.<A NAME="7.7"><A HREF="#7">&#181;</A></a> Hoarding change could become a criminal offense when dealing with pluti. I can just imagine the headlines as coin collectors and little old ladies unwittingly reach super critical mass with their coins and level whole city blocks....<br><B>Int. Apartment Room Day</B><br><table width =500><tr><td valign = top width = 5><br></td><td valign = top width = 490>An old woman sits counting change at a small desk in front of an open window. She's softly humming to herself. All over the interior of the room are an immense number of cats. Meowing, sitting, eating, they dominate the room. Outside, the day is brilliantly clear. The sky so empty that one gets a sense of what infinity means. As the woman continues counting all other sounds fade out. This is emphasized by shots of cats meowing without any noise. Closeup of the woman's hand as it reaches for the 50th pluti. Cut to shot out of focus and slow motion. Woman's hand enters the scene slowly. The only sound is the woman humming, real time.

However, there still exist people out there who, for whatever reason - usually pride - are unwilling to reach out, however tentatively, pressing their slender, cold fingers into the Great Grab-Bag-O'-Life. that is the American Welfare System proffered to the public by thousands of reverent do-gooders, who most commonly resemble high school bullies ("Do you want this? You're gonna have to reach for it. Oh you can reach farther than that.).<br>  <dd>In a way, welfare is very similar to faerie food: faerie lore indicates that if you ever encounter a fae or enter their Realm, you should never eat their food. Besides the obvious fact that it taste like piss, it binds you to their world forever. Using a more familiar example, Persephone ate an undisclosed number of seeds from the pomegranate after being spirited away by Pluto to Hades and is forced to return to His dark realm every year, causing grief in her mother Demeter, who lets the land die (winter).<br> <dd>Welfare seems all too similar; if you accept their help, offered in genuine good will, you may be bound to them for the rest of your life. <BR><A HREF="#2.2">&#164; </A>Helpful Hint&#153: Inbreeding often causes insanity among the ruling classes, and disorientation among the less well to do.

One example are the Yapese people of the Caroline Islands in the Pacific. There, huge stone donut shaped discs are used as a kind of currency. Villages will exchange these massive disks for services with one another and erect them around the village to display their wealth and power. Once, while one of these behemoth was being transported across a lagoon for payment, it toppled into the sea. The poor people struggled to retrieve the stone, but conditions prevented it. In a stroke of genius, some brainiac suggested that, just because the stone was in the sea didn't mean it wasn't the village's. They could still own the stone and have that prestige even though no one saw it. In effect, they invented banking. It is unknown whether other stone discs were deposited into the First Yapese Harbor, but the interest earned off the first stone alone is allowing the villagers to live at ease.<BR><A HREF="#6.6">&#167;</A>The Magic Penny Song:<br><dd>Love is something if you give it away, give it away, give it away.

After a few weeks we finally noticed the unusual smell coming from the change bottle. Of course all the coins had to be washed, but the bonus was that the urine has stripped the silver off of most of the coins. Whenever we paid with those greenish, ancient looking coins, we received curious looks.
