Hell's Kitchen has been wired up. That's right, we've been U-Wired. Hell's Kitchen is now part of a  network of college newspapers from around the nation, with access to all news and opinion articles from any available member publications. This means that Hell's Kitchen will be read across the land, from Princeton to U. Wisconsin and even USA Today. On a more profound level, it also means that students from RIT can actually read pertinent news articles that are cohesive, well-written, and researched. Best of all, these articles are written by students, they may not be from RIT, but we can't have everything on our wish list now can we?<br> <dd>This means that if you write for us, some newspaper editor in Omaha may read your stuff. You may get offers. Sexual if nothing else.<p><dd>Additional love note: To the anonymous creature who stashed $20 in the Hell folder....You have our highest regard. You gave us 90 issues and a phone call. Thanks.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
