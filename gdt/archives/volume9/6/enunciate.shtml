The Spice Girls, England's prefab ladies "fresh'in'in your drinks, Gov'nar" ran the table at the American Music Awards, capturing all awards they were nominated for and their movie is behind only "Titanic" in the box office take for this week.<br><dd>The idea of corporations creating artists is nothing new; it has been around as long as recorded music itself. Labels scour the country-and indeed now the world-looking for new talent and new sounds. My father tells a story of seeing an obscure musician in a bar near Philadelphia PA, the musician would later become one of the leading voices of the "Folk-Rock" movement of the 1970's.<br>  <dd>I have no problem with this.<br>  <dd>What I have a problem with is that the corporate giants that control the music industry seem to be trying to hold the Spice Girls up as the face of women in music. I don't buy into that at all. I don't play that game. The Spice Girls are riding a trend that started with the debut of MtV.  If you can't be talented, you can get by on good looks alone. MtV has allowed musicians, both male and female, with limited musical talents but gifted with movie-star faces and bodies, to become superstars. Not that looks and talent aren't mutually exclusive, but I have seen many untalented musicians that look good on TV become stars.<br>  <dd>The true face of women in music to me is to be found at the opposite end of the musical spectrum, in a group of musicians that is reviving a tradition that seemed to be killed off with the age of MtV. I'm talking about a new generation of female singer-songwriters. This contemporary brigade is led by the venerable Indigo Girls, who have been putting out introspective and powerful music for the last decade. Tori Amos and Fiona Apple follow in the blues-based tradition of Janis Joplin, utilizing powerful voices to convey poetic lyrics.  Musicians like Tracy Chapman and Erkah Badu follow in the tradition of legendary musicians like Billie Holiday, and Eta James. And what list of these musicians would be complete with mentioning the ultimate anti-Spice Girl, Ani DiFranco? This Buffalo, NY native has thumbed her nose totally at the corporate music industry by releasing all of her music on her own label.  These musicians command a loyal and fiercely devoted group of fans.  A testament to these musicians popularity is the fact that the Lilith Fair, with its all-female line up of acts was one of the top grossing tours of the summer.<br><dd>The music industry may be trying to feed the public pretty faces, but I want more.  And I know how to find it!<br> <table width = 250><tr><td valign = top bgcolor = #000000><font color = white><B><I>Visit www.rit.edu/~jld2705/enunciator/<br>enunciator_home.html for more material from The Enunciator.
