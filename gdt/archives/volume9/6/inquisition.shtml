One of the things he mentioned was abductions.  Well, I got to thinking what if I were abducted by aliens and instead of being tested, I was interrogated.  Here are a few questions I think any alien would ask and what my answers would be....<p><IMG width = 200 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/inquisition.gif"><br><dd>You humans seem to have different appearances. Can you explain this?<br><dd>I do not know.  Perhaps because we are so dispersed across this planet, our appearances differ to allow us to survive in different locations.<br><dd>Why do certain people see this as such a problem?<br><dd>Some people on this world cannot accept such differences, and they seek out others who share this idea.  This also extends to other differences, not just appearance. You have divided your planet into territories, even though from here there do not appear to be any divisions.<br>  <dd>Why?<br><dd>We humans, like many of the other animals I'm sure you have observed, are territorial creatures.  We divide land into territory that we claim as ours. Many disputes have been fought over this issue.<br><dd>That is what worries us about you humans; you have created the power to totally destroy each other and this whole planet.<br>  <dd>People have asked that question for centuries. For some reason we feel more secure sometimes knowing we can destroy each other if we wish.<br><dd>You humans also misuse resources, including your own people.<br>  <dd>Some of our people feel that they have the right to misuse resources and people to pursue personal goals.   They do not realize the harm that such actions do until it is too late. But there are those among us who see this as wrong and work to stop this from happening; those who wish to continue to exploit sometimes harass, discredit and in some cases kill those who fight this.<br><dd>We worry about your kind.  You have the potential to do great things, yet much of your effort is devoted to tribal conflicts and exploitation.<br><dd>Do worry, as there is much to worry about.  But there is also hope, as people see the evil before them, many become motivated to do good as well.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/jd.html">James D'Angelo</A> <br> </html>
