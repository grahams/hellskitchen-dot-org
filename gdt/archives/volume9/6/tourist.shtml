I LOVE PORN! I LOOOOO-VVVVVEEEE PORN! There is nothing more satisfying than a six hour non-stop, wall to wall, top to bottom, sexextravaganza. None of that wining and dining shit, no messy relationship communication problems, no pesky run-ins with angry pimps or local law enforcement. Just you in the comfort of your own home, one hand on the fast forward button, the other...well, depending on the company, the other could be in a number of places. Some say that porn is degrading, dehumanizing, and sad. IT'S FUCKING PORN!!! You think that double-penetration, double jelly dong, greased fists of love, anal ripcord bead, all American ball slappin action is healthy???<br> <dd>Certainly not. What are you stupid?<br> <dd>The stars are emotionally scarred drug addicts with bad teeth, and the frequent viewers of porn are depraved lunatics that treat sex as a detached function of the id. And by Jove, I'm one of em! Who cares how it hurts you, as long as it fills the void, right? Porn is arousing, amusing, and guilt free!  I think that all children, beginning in kindergarten, should be forced to watch some of the classic porn films of our times.  An eight-year-old with extensive knowledge of Ron Jeremy's filmography will most definitely go far in life.<br> <dd>Trust me.<br>  <dd>And now, for those who may not be versed in porno appreciation, I give you...<br>T<FONT SIZE = -1>OURIST'S</font size> G<FONT SIZE = -1>UIDE TO</font size> W<FONT SIZE = -1>ATCHING</font size> P<FONT SIZE = -1>ORNO:</font size><dd><B>1. Physical attributes of porn stars are pretty standard.</B> There's the porno hair, which comes in three styles - Ron Jeremy-white-guy-afro-style, Peter North-hyper-perfect-bouffant-style, and TTBoy/Yanni-long-hair-style.<br> <dd>Porno teeth are like the Royal Family's teeth after a hockey season. Porno fingernails must be at least three inches long (to accommodate the nose candy addiction). Know your porno star by the attribute that is most prominent.<br><dd><B>2. Fast forward etiquette.</B> When watching alone, fast forward at your leisure, but when in a large group, fast forward only after giving notice and inquiring as to if anyone would like to continue at normal speed. It is acceptable to exclaim "prepare to fast-forward....fast-forward....fast-forwarding, sir..." before  fastforwarding begins. (Note:  You may experience what is known as the "Sewing machine effect" while fast-forwarding through penetration scenes. This is normal.)<br><dd><B>3. When a person excuses him or herself to use the restroom, DO NOT under any circumstances inquire as to their true motives.</B> It is a porno faux pas to say "You're going to spank it, aren't you? Ha Ha!" This is not appreciated in any way, and makes it uncomfortable for people to properly "relieve" themselves. When someone gets up, smile knowingly, and don't come into contact with their hands when they get back.<br> <dd><B>4. Porno stars CAN NOT act!</B>  Don't react as if it's some grand revelation. Porn watchers are there for the gooey moments, not for adequate demonstrations of Stanislovky's Method. Suspend disbelief at the FBI warning, if you please. It is ok, however, to make fun of the cheezy dialog and horrible segues with your own witty quips and remarks a la MST3K.<br>  <dd><B>5. Porno Tracking. </B>It is preferable to have a VCR from the early 1980's (the golden age of porn), because you can adjust the tracking to 'porno tracking' rather easily. Where normal videotapes do not usually need much adjustment, porno tapes require the tracking to go all the way to one side or another. On new VCR's you may have to fool the VCR by recording a small segment of "Family Matters" or "Toy Story" prior to the feature presentation. This helps to overcome obnoxious calibration problems that arise with automatic tracking features on new VCRs.<br><center><table width = 200><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG width = 200 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/tourist.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>Base sensationalism to get readers? What are you talking about?</center></B></font size><br></td></tr></table><br></center><dd><B>6. Porno Music.</B> Say it with me: "Huaka-Joe" (pronounced 'wok- uh- jowe'), this or variations like "Huaka- Chicka" ('wok-a-chih-ke), or "Ber- ner, Chik- A- Boo- Bwow" ('buh- nuhr- chih- kuh- kwoo- buhwouh) should be repeated over and over in unison with the others present when the music begins. After about 1983, the music went from the wonderful sex-o-rama style described above to cheezy synthesizer music. I recommend playing classical music and turning down the sound on your TV. My favorites are Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", Bach's "Tocatta and Fugue in D minor", and anything off the John Tesh Project.<br><dd><B>7. It is ok for sexually secure males to comment on the abnormally large genitals of the leading male stars.</B>  "That's a meaty hog on that guy."<br> <dd>"Yes, I agree, that is quite the massive schlong..."<br> <dd>Females may also comment on how skanky the women leads are, as well as pointing out any and all plastic surgery that may have taken place.<br><dd><B>8. Above all, have fun, learn, enjoy! </B> If anyone gives you attitude about your motives or morals, tell them that Tourist said to eat a fat one! That'll shut them up.  Remember, this is a free country, and it's your choice to frustrate yourself with your friends.
