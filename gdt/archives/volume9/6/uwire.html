There's no explanation. It just happens. But if you move back, you quickly remember why you left in the first place. The following three examples are reasons why people sometimes shake their heads when you proudly state you are from Texas. Truly, there are more ridiculous happenings of late than can hardly be discussed in a mere 650-word column, but here's a shot at it.<br><dd>For one thing, who ever heard of anything as ludicrous as a "beef defamation lawsuit." Yesiree, we have reached a new low in political correctness. Seems that a beef defamation lawsuit could also be called a "Let's Repeal the First Amendment lawsuit" but that's a whole column in and of itself.<br><center><IMG width = 200 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/uwire.gif"><br></center><dd>Poor Oprah. That'll teach her to speak her mind. Better to keep quiet when it comes to talking about food safety, especially when it deals with cattle from Texas. There can't be many things worse than spending five weeks in Amarillo fighting cowboys who've been emasculated by their sputtering bovine profits.<br><dd>Listen up, Oprah: It's not enough that you bring grace and intelligence to daytime TV, nor is it enough that you donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to put kids through college. You be nice to the cattle, or it's all gone.<dd>To further illustrate the insanity overcoming Texas is a juicy story from New Braunfels. It seems there's someone who has made it her mission to keep all HEB stores free from dirty words. The unfortunate thing is that she has managed to coerce local police officials to help her trounce the First Amendment. So she didn't like a kid's Marilyn Manson shirt that stated, "I am the god of f---."<br><dd>Did she confront his mother? Did she politely ask him to turn his shirt inside out? No. Instead, this woman called a police officer over, who promptly cuffed the boy, hauled him outside of the store and took a poll on whether the shirt was offensive.<br><dd>Wait, now what century is it? What country is this? The boy's lucky his mamma called the ACLU, or the people of New Braunfels might have had 'em a good old-fashioned witch burnin'. Poor kid. He ought to have pointed at the old lady, called her beehive hairdo a phallic symbol and had her arrested too. Oh, but we forget; police harass young people, not upstanding older individuals.<br><dd>And the grand finale of recent stupidness is a funny little tale that happened right here in our own backyard. One of our fine UTPD officers went a little haywire when he saw a fake foot protruding from the back of a van.<br><dd>It seems that anyone remotely conscious would find it hard to believe that a van door would shut perfectly on a human leg, leaving the foot hanging out. But as the officer spotted the foot he drew his gun and apprehended the van's driver. Don't forget that this all happened in Round Rock. Sound a little confusing? Maybe that's why UTPD is conducting an investigation.<br><dd>So what's the moral here folks? Be very, very careful. Texas is a great state. It's warm in January, there are beautiful flowers in the spring and it houses at least one very fine institution of higher education, but watch out. There are crazies everywhere. If you think you might have a distaste for beef, a mind of your own or a sense of humor, you better get out while you can. Pretty soon we'll find road blocks set up and if your car isn't equipped with a "Texas Native" bumper sticker and/or one that proudly states, "Eat Beef," you'll be in big trouble.<br><dd>And don't even start in on the Cowboys. There's probably an anti-football defamation law on the books.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
