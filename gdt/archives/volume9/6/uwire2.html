Susan Goldin-Meadow, professor in the departments of psychology and education and the College, and Carolyn Mylandor, a project researcher in psychology, published a study in the January 15 edition of the journal Nature entitled "Spontaneous Sign Systems Created by Deaf Children in Two Cultures."<br> <dd>The researchers studied two sets of four children in the United States and Taiwan. The children had no training in standard sign language, but they were able to develop their own form of communicating with their parents using gestures to form complex sentences.<br> <dd>The researchers found over 10,000 individual gestures used by the children. The gesture systems were similar to each other, but did not resemble English or Mandarin Chinese.<br> <dd>The language used by the children uses what linguists call an ergative structure. In this structure, the object is placed before the verb. Neither English nor Mandarin Chinese use an ergative structure.<br> <dd>One difference between the samples in the two countries is that the Taiwanese parents were able to communicate partly in the children's language, while the American parents were not. One conclusion is that the Taiwanese parents influenced the children's language. However, the gestures of the Taiwanese children were very similar to those of the American children, possibly proving that the Taiwanese parents learned the language from their children.<br><br> <dd>"Given the salient differences between Chinese and American cultures, the structural similarities in the children's gesture systems are striking," explained Goldin-Meadow. "These structural properties - consistent marking of semantic elements by deletion and ordering, and linking of propositions within a single sentence - are developmentally robust in humans."<br> <dd>The fact that American parents were not able to use their children's language proves that the children learned the language independently of their parents.<br> <dd>Some experts believe that self-developed gestures may make it easier for children to learn American Sign Language (ASL). Like the home-taught gestures, ASL bears little resemblance to English. Mandarin Sign Language is a little more similar to it's spoken equivalent. However, the optimal age to begin formal training in ASL is three years old.<br> <dd>Goldin-Meadow has done research in the communication skills of deaf children for over 20 years. She videotapes the children gesturing with their parents. She only uses children without formal ASL training because they are the least exposed to formal language.<br> <dd>She is also a faculty associate of the recently created Robert R. McCormick Tribune Initiative on Early Child Development and Policy.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
