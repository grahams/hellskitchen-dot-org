Lewis, the Faculty Maintenance Operations issued returning students comfy two-ply toilet paper.<br>  <dd> The tale behind the two-ply begins last fall, when a junior columnist for The Harvard Crimson lobbied for an improvement in this most basic criterion of living standards.<br>  <dd>Geoffrey Upton '99 said he wrote his column to complain that the Student Council should concentrate on bettering the basics of student life, such as toilet paper, rather than the luxuries, such as cable television.<br>  <dd>"I can speak for all students when I say it makes our bathrooms more user-friendly," Upton said. "Harvard is a nicer place now that the toilet paper is softer."<br>  <dd>Upton wrote in his Crimson column: "You don't think Dean of College Henry R. Lewis '68 goes home to one-ply every night, do you?"  <dd>After Upton published his column in The Crimson, Ted Wright ran for the Student Council on the slogan "Cleaning up the [University Council] with two-ply toilet paper."<br>  <dd>Harvard certainly has received its share of media attention following the change. Television networks including CNN and newspapers across the country are covering the event.<br>  <dd>"People in the national press are going nuts. There are more important things happening in the nation and in The Crimson," Upton said.<br>  <dd>On Jan. 9, The Crimson reported on the change from the Scott one-ply to the James River Multi-layer two-ply toilet paper. Though the James River is cheaper at $31.31 per case as opposed to the Scott at $34.44 a case, the Scott comes in thicker rolls.<br>  <dd>"A high-level committee called the Harvard College Toilet Paper Commission... met weekly all fall to consider this important issue," Lewis wrote in an e-mail to students.<br>  <dd> Yale currently uses one-ply Cormatic Ultima Tissue made by Clean Choice.<br>  <dd> And Yalies are certainly in favor of a change to two-ply.<br>  <dd> "My butt cheeks have been chafing for two-ply," Marc Bush '01 said.<br>  <dd> "One-ply is pretty crappy," added Patrick Armstrong '01.<br>  <dd> Harvard students are not, however, as quick to praise their new comfort.<br>  <dd> "Most of us have no idea about the change and are neutral about it. There hasn't been a lot of publicity about this momentous shift," said Dafna Hochman, a Harvard sophomore.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images6/uwire2.gif"><br>  <dd>Last year the Yale College Council unsuccessfully petitioned the Yale Corporation for liquid soap, storage shelves and two-ply in the bathrooms.<br>  <dd>"I'm glad Harvard got it done, but from last year's experience with the administration, it's an impossibility. In a common sensical way, it is a luxury we don't need. It would be nice, but it is not a necessity," said Jeremy Fain '99, projects committee chair.<br>  <dd>YCC President Kimberly Taylor '99 was more optimistic about the prospects.<br>  <dd>"We attempted to preempt Harvard in this matter in fall of last year," Taylor said. "Perhaps we can begin [this semester] to refocus on improving the bathroom facilities."<br>  <dd>Yale administrators said they sympathize with the students' needs.<br>  <dd> "Students have been asking for this for a while. Maybe we'll do it so we don't get outdone by Harvard, but I happen to think it's more important to get soap and paper towels in the bathrooms," Dean of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg said.<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/6/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
