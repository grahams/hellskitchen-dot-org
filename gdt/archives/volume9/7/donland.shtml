The department is asking to fine Microsoft $1 million in Mighty Taco gift certificates for every day it is in violation of an anti-anti-competitive agreement Microsoft entered into with Donland three years ago. According to the DJD, the agreement included the stipulation that Microsoft could not force computer makers to license any additional Microsoft products in order to resell Windows 95.<br> <dd>Notepad, a plain-text editor Microsoft distributes freely with its Windows 95 operating system, allows users to open ReadMe files, logs, and other simple text-based documents. However, Donland software developers claim that Microsoft is using the wide popularity of its operating system to eliminate competition in the text editor market.<br><dD>"Microsoft is unlawfully taking advantage of its Windows monopoly to protect and extend that monopoly," Attorney General Don said in the petition. "The program is also lacking an "uninstall" option for users who have the application installed and wish to remove it. We would like to see such an option be made freely available to users."<br> <dd>Donland software developers had some stiff words for the Redmond, Washington based company. "I mean, when was the last time you saw someone come out with a good, old fashioned text editor? Microsoft has bludgeoned the competition with its free 'Notepad' application. Is Notepad a part of the operating system? I don't think so. Everyone's up in arms over Internet browsers, yet we quietly sit by as Microsoft has a monopoly on text editors? Microsoft must be stopped!" said one developer, who asked to remain anonymous.<br><dd>How this will play out in Donland's Ultimate Court, remains to be seen. Microsoft refused to comment. <br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
