I think I'm going to get under the table now...whoa, I found a penny!"), the President's State of the Union address is the closest to a Battle Royal as you get here in the states. Great Britain is another story. The folks in Parliament know words that even the kids in the second grade haven't heard yet...and they're not afraid to use them. You think the Spice Girls had tongues ripped right off the streets of Sussex? You should have seen good ol' Maggie T. when she'd throw a major wobbler.<br><dd>Anyway, I was watching the State of the Union speech, pointing out to Josh French that people in the audience would clap at inappropriate times to throw off the rhythm of the President's speech, when Fucko the clown walks in and sits down. Fucko, normally kibitzing with our sister group, the <I>Melancholy Homewrecker</I>, hangs out with us every now and then. Usually its just to peek into the room I happen to be in, laugh in the way only he can, and then disappear into the rathole that is his room.<br><dd>This particular time, Fucko plopped down on the couch next to me, coquettishly crossed his legs so a floppy clown shoe hit my knee, and watched the speech. After a few moments filled with squirming, foot tapping, and a light mist of steam rising from his ears, I knew he had something on his mind.<br><dd>"You know," he began, his voice filling the air like the powdery bliss of Lipton Instant Iced Tea mix, "If I were a terrorist-and I'm not saying I am-but if I were a terrorist and wanted to put a hurting on the US, that's right where I'd do it."<br><dd>Extending an arm with a filthy glove, presumably white at some point in the past and now smelling disturbingly like mold and...um, stuff, toward the TV, he waggled an oversized digit at the image of the packed room.<br><dd>"Yup. Take out all the important politicians in one attempt."<br><dd>I proceeded to explain that the security around an event like that was (I hoped) extremely high. No one without authorization could get near...especially a clown with a shaved head and goatee packing an Uzi and slightly used enema tubing.<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a><br><dd>"I wow-I mean a terrorist-wouldn't have to get that close. Just a bomb would d-"<br> <dd>"Um, security would still-"<br><dd>"OK you little shit! One word: 747. What are they going to do? Shoot me down? If I'm going fast enough and carrying enough boom-boom, I'm pretty sure I could still reach 'um. Divine wind baby!"<br><dd>As I gazed into his amazingly clear and lucid eyes, I could see what he was describing in its ragnarokian splendor....<br><dd>The passenger plane, hijacked from an airport near D.C., maybe somewhere in Maryland, maybe Virginia, silently makes its way through the India ink dusk. On the ground, events are unfolding and questions are being answered. Why have they taken control of the plane? What do they want? How many prisoners?<br><dd>But there are no prisoners. Only a lone clown -<br><dd>"Not a clown, you asswhore! I said I wouldn't do it-"<br><dd>- a lone terrorist, decked out with oversized shoes and filthy gloves -<br><dd>"Don't push it, pixie boy."<dd><dd>- calmly sits at the controls, guiding his acquired vehicle-with the help of laminar flow-toward its destination. The radio squawks at him periodically: To the individual in control of flight 835. You must alter your course and bring your heading to one-zero-niner. Please respond.<br><dd>Instead, he continues to hum to himself, as though thoroughly enjoying the evening sky.<br><dd>"Kill the wabbit. Kill the wabbit. Kill the wabbit!"<br><dd>In time, a very short time, the plotters and schemers on the ground ken exactly what it is that he has planned. My God. He's going to crash into the Capital.<br><dd>The interceptors are scrambled to remove the threat by all means necessary, but it is too late. The rockets slam home, ripping holes into the fragile skin of the icarian bird, and it falls from the heavens. Fire and steel rain down on the buildings below. My fellow Americans is cut short as the sound of explosions are broadcast around the world, in stereo where available. After, it would be raining Ash for weeks.<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a><br><dd>In one fell swoop Fuc-I mean a terrorist-would effectively and efficiently bring the government to its knees. Then again, it's not as if prostitutes haven't been doing that exact same thing to many of the powers-that-be anyhow.<br><IMG width = 350 align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images7/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Thankfully, authority rolls down hill and eventually it will hit someone (Eww, you've got a little bit of ick on your shirt sleeve). The system was set up with knowledge that Presidents, and even Vice Presidents, die and there is a whole hierarchy of people who are in line for becoming President: Vice President, Speaker of the House, Sec. State, Sec. Treasury, Sec. Defense, Sec. of Spice, Attorney General, Sec. Interior, Sec. Agriculture, Sec. Commerce, Sec. Labor, the Secretariat, Sec. Health and Human Services, Sec. Housing and Urban Development, Sec. Transportation, Sec. Energy, the Guy who works behind the Counter at the Gift Shop, Sec. Education...on it goes down the list. But with the State of the Union address, everyone who is anyone is supposed to be there.<br><dd>Everyone, that is, but the Postmaster General.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a><br><dd>The Postmaster General. A rugged individualist, set apart from his fellow postmen by one outstanding trait: He owns no guns. Not a shotgun, not a pistol, not a rifle to be found in his immaculately kept home. He doesn't need them, as he is a man necessarily skilled in the deadly arts and the patient torment of canines. Aggressive, powerful, and a stunning dresser, he is a man to be reckoned with; a man to strike fear into the hearts of middle-class Americans depending on their mail-order catalogs and checks blissfully placed in the mail. Mail? More than any other man, he is the mail. And the hand that delivers the mail is the hand that rocks the world.<br><dD>Or so Marvin Runyon thinks.<br><dD>Imagine, Marvin Runyon, Postmaster General of the United States of America, being awakened in the middle of the night from whatever dark dream it is that Postmen have (What do postmen dream about? Things that would make you quiver with fear and anticipation).<br><dd>"Mr Runyon? This is Robert from Postal Center 17. I have some bad news, sir. Are you sitting down?"<br><dd>"Well, more or less," he mumbles wiping the sleep from his eyes.<br><dd>"Sir, there's been a terrorist act at the Capital. Everyone's dead. You're the President, sir."<br><dd>"What? Clinton?"<br><dd>"He's dead sir."<br><dd>"What about Al Gore?"<br><dd>"He's dead. They're all dead, sir "<br><dd>"Boy, Starr isn't going to be happy..."<br><dd>"He's dead too, sir. EVERYBODY is DEAD, sir."<br><dd>"Katchanski isn't dead, is she?"<br><dd>"Yes, she's dead, sir. Everybody is dead. Everybody is dead, sir."<br><dD>"What you're trying to say is that everybody is dead?"<br><dD>"Gordon Bennet! I never should have woken you up!"<br><dd>"So, by law, I'm the President and have 3 more years in office?"<br><dd>"Yes sir, Mr. President, sir."<br><dd>"Hot damn! Get your gun, Bobby! It's time to make some mail bombs. Do you still have the list of all those people who voted for the young Elvis stamp?"<br><dd>"Yes sir, Mr. President sir! I've been waiting all my life for this!"<br><dd>Without the checks-and-balances of the political system, democracy would be swept aside and replaced with a benevolent dictator: Marvin Runyon, once Postmaster General now General `n Chief. Under his enlightened leadership, swift action become the rule of the day. Potential bills would be marked next-day, first-class, third-class, or book-rate, and cost lawmakers accordingly.<br><dd>Using his thousands of loyal war-vets delivering mail to pass the time before the Rule of the Postmen, the spirit of the law, if not its letter, would be upheld. At first fear would grip the populace. After all, these were the same men they had instinctively feared for years; the men with funny shorts and socks pulled up over their knees; the men behind the counter who could count stamps without looking at them; the men who would go on killing rages if they couldn't find their jellybabies.<br> <dD>But the system would work. With post offices becoming the centers of government operation the new police, the Postmen, would know everyone in their neighborhoods. They would look after their people and crime would drop. What good is it to be a suspected criminal and risk not having your mail delivered? In time, the civilians would look upon the men they once feared and say with pride, "Neither rain, nor sleet, nor gloom of night, shall keep them from their appointed rounds."<br><dd>And slowly, the country would change.<br><dd>Auto makers would begin producing vehicles with steering wheels on the opposite side and strangely, road-rage would disappear. Stamps would slowly replace our current currency. For the first time in our nations pitifully short history, works of art, wildflowers, sailing ships, historical events, and cartoon characters would fill our banks and pockets, and people would become strangely optimistic.<br><dd>But there would be a dark side to the New Way. Sending letters would not only be a way of communicating with friends, family, and creditors, but your national responsibility. The senders of chain letters could be executed for subversion and treason. Damn-it! The mail must go through!<br> <dd>Woe unto the neighborhoods with low mail traffic. To rectify such situations, the Postmaster would send in the Letter Gestapo. Many a night will the unsuspecting family be awakened by a snarled "Postage Due!" and a kick in the throat.<br><dD>Though sad, it is inevitable that Postmen and their charges will be lost in the line of duty. For those brave patriots and the inadequately addressed mail, there will be the Tomb of the Unknown Letter. Each year, thousands of poorly addressed and undeliverable messages will be deposited at the Tomb, where two guards stand watchful while another Postmen slowly and methodically feeds the letters, one-by-one, into the eternal flame.<br><dD>In my mind, I can hear the sound of as yet unborn children singing a child's remembrance of history waiting to happen.<br><dD>"You better not slouch, you better not shout, you better not pout I'm telling you why...Marvin Runyan's coming to town. He'll see you when you're sleeping, he'll know when you're awake. He'll know if you've been bad or good, 'cause he's big brother on the make..."<br><dd>I shake my head and clear the image from my mind. Fucko is still sitting there, looking at me.<br><dd>"Or," he says laying down and using Buckminsterfullerene the Cat as a very comfy C50 compound, "I suppose I could just vote in the next elections." <br><IMG width =500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images7/1.2.gif"><br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A>California engineers are ready to prove to the world that you don't need to make vehicles with the center of gravity higher than eye level to watch a really good car flip.
