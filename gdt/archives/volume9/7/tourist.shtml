Uncle Jack is looking good in his older age.  Damn scary though.  As the ten year anniversary of the first Batman movie approaches(remember that they made it in 1988, and released it in 89), I look at St. Nicholson and realize that HE IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST MEN OF ALL TIME!!!  This is especially apparent in this film, because the principal photography consists mainly of close-up shots.  On the big screen, when Jack flashes that staple grin at you, and his face is sixteen feet wide, you know that he truly is one frightening bastard.  Can you imagine waking up one night, going to the bathroom and seeing Jack smiling at you in the bathtub?  Or what if you encountered him in a dark alley.  After voiding both bladder and colon, I personally would scream like a little bitch and look for things to throw.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that he's a pretty nice guy, but I'll bet that when he "steps out", he really steps out! Remember that incident a few years back, when he beat the bejesus out of some guy's windshield in Manhattan rush hour traffic?  If I were the driver of that car, I would have swallowed my own tongue.  Why?  Cause Jack Nicholson is a SCARY MOTHERFUCKER, that's why!<br><dD>"Honey, a peculiar thing happened on the way home from work today."<br><dd>"Really?  What, dear?"<br><dd>"Well, I was driving down Seventh Ave, and out of nowhere, Jack Nicholson jumped on my hood and bashed in my windshield with a nine-iron."<br><dd>"Jack Nicholson, you say?"<br><dd>"Yes, Jack Nicholson."<br><dD>"He's one scary motherfucker."<br><dd>"Tell me about it. I voided both my bladder and colon, and then swallowed my own tongue."<br><table width = 250><tr><td valign =top><center><IMG SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images7/tourist.gif"><br><font size = +1><B>Not only a member.

If human cloning takes off, as it should, I'm hoping that ole' Jack donates his genetic code to the US Government.  Clone about fifty million Jack Nicholsons, and send them into Iraq.  That'll teach em!  Don't fuck with the United States.  Why?  Because we've got an army of Jack Nicholsons - pissed off, armed to the teeth, and if the genetic wizards prevail, with sixteen foot wide heads, THAT'S WHY!<br><dd>"Saddam, we've got problems.  Our ground troops are retreating."<br><dd>"Why?  Why, damn you!"<br><dd>"They've encountered the US infantry, sir.  They're terrified.  Most of them have voided both their bladders and their colons, some of them have even swallowed their own tongues."<br><dd>"Why? Scared of what?"<br><dd>"Sir, the US infantry consists of several million Jack Nicholson clones, with sixteen foot wide heads, sir."<br><dd>"Jack Nicholson?  The scariest motherfucker on the planet?"<br><dd>"That would be correct, sir."<br><dd>"We're fucked."<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/7/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
