NASA complied. Ethical questions aside (why is NASA pandering to someone responsible for reviewing its budget? Why is the issue of old people in space a valid one?), this move is clearly a cheap public relations gimmick to revitalize waning public interest in America's space program. They're sending one of America's original heroes into the heavens for a last hurrah, and they know America will be watching.<br> <dD>Well I say phooey on all that! If NASA wants to mix politics and space missions, then they should do it right. This could be an effective public relations tool for NASA as well as Congress, especially if they add some scandal and excitement.<br> <dd>Americans love drama. More people tuned in to this year's State of the Union address than last year's. Not because they wanted to hear President Clinton pat himself on the back, but because they wanted to see if Clinton would say anything about "the scandal". This inadvertently brought the public's attention back to national politics (the Pope went where?).<br> <dd>If NASA were to, say, send Congress members into space - with some added spice, of course - people would begin to vote and maybe even to read again. Even in West Virginia!<br> <dD>Just imagine, a bipartisan committee could be sent into space with Glenn to study the effects of space travel on politics. On board would be Republicans Trent Lott, Jesse Helms and Alfonso D'Amato. For the Democrats, we'd have Dick Gephart to study the effects of whining and space travel. For the effects of space travel on libido, there'd be Ted Kennedy.<br> <dD>Things would go wrong from the beginning. Lott does nothing but talk about Ole Miss. Glenn insists on watching Cocoon over and over. Gephart whines about the inequality of the NASA program, hence the lack of women and minorities on the mission.<br> <dd>"Shut up, girlie boy," Helms yells. "We couldn't bring women - Kennedy's on board!"<br> <dd>Suddenly, a comet passes. Lott stands up and tries to rally his Republican colleagues. "We must follow the comet!" he cries out passionately. "When we're one with the comet, we'll leave our earthly containers, rise above our human existence and the GOP will become relevant again!"<br> <dD>The GOP attempts to take control of the ship - but watch out for the stowaway! Oh no, it's William Weld, and he's come to kill Jesse Helms! D'Amato goes for the tackle, and Weld loses his head. No, he doesn't literally lose his head, silly readers. Weld's mask comes off as he's tackled. Turns out he's none other than Bob Kerry.<br> <dd>"I knew you weren't a real Republican," Lott says.<br> <dd>The ship chases the comet and the hijinks continue. There's a parallel universe where everyone sees Sonny Bono floating in space evolving from old Bono to '60s Bono to fetus Bono. Then our beloved Congressionauts throw a party when they arrive at Mir to discover the space station took control of itself and killed off all the Russians ("I'm sorry, Ivan. I can't let you do that").<br> <dd>And Glenn, showing the world that American senior citizens can master space as well as anyone, does a perfect job piloting the ship to safety. Well, almost perfect.<br> <dd>"Discovery ... this is Houston Control ... your turn signal is on."<br>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/7/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/uwire.html">Other U-Wire Articles in this Volume</A><br><A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A><br></nobr></font size></center><p><table border width = 400><tr><td valign = top><B><dd><font size = +1>U-Wire Affiliation</B></font size><br>Hell's Kitchen, GDT's parent group, is a member publication of U-Wire, a conglomeration of publications from across the nation.
