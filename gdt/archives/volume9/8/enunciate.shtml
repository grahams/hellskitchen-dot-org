Why and when did you get this idea into your head?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Basically, it was last year. I started looking at the issue, checking out sources, facts on the internet, some books, and I found that everything I'd been taught about marijuana and drugs in particular has been a lie.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> You don't have to answer this, but did you use marijuana in high school?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> I tried it a couple of times, never really used it a lot.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> One person, so what. What gave you the idea to take this to the rest of the RIT population?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> I guess it was because I see a problem, a big problem, and I just want to do my part in trying to solve that problem. I figured the best way to do that was to get people organized and work towards the same I want to.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> One of the things that, in my opinion, attracted attention to your group, was when you counter attacked an anti-marijuana display in the SAU[Student Alumni Union].<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> That display pretty much used all the hype; "marijuana causes brain damage", "marijuana makes you lazy", "marijuana causes lung damage", and so on and so forth. And we confronted them-the SAISD[a substance group concentrating on the deaf population at RIT]-with the facts, and we were told that they respected us for our opinion, but that the display was staying up. So we did postering just letting people know that what was in the display was not right.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> I heard on the news, and you told me later, that you actually had problems getting you club organized.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> We didn't have problems getting organized. The school attempted to deny us recognition before we even applied for recognition, and we let them know that we weren't gonna let them shut us down like that.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> Were you thinking of having to bring in the ACLU or someone like that?<BR><IMG width = 250 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images8/enunciate.gif"><br> <DD><B>SG:</B> We had the backing of the ACLU and the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws(NORML), as well as some other private lawyers backing us up. I mean we had a rock-solid case, the school was right in backing down so quickly.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> The other question I have is that do you fear that with marijuana legalization that you may see a domino effect?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> I would actually hope so. The way we deal with drugs now is counter- productive, and doesn't accomplish anything. We criminalize a large portion of our population because they chose to use a recreational drug besides that which the government says you should use: alcohol and tobacco. The whole drug situation has been hyped up. Drugs are not a major problem in the United States, drug prohibition is, and drugs are just an excuse that politicians use to blame anything bad on.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> Would you not say though, that legalizing marijuana and other drugs would in a sense be a concession to the drug kingpins?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> NO! The drug kingpins don't want drugs legalized at all, they'd lose all their profits. You legalize drugs, you end all the criminal syndicates involved in drugs. The big drug people, they don't want it legalized, that's the worst thing that could happen to their business. Italy has actually legalized drugs in an effort to battle the mafia because they were making a lot of money off drugs.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> OK, you always mention that the media has a war on drugs, but I've noticed that in the past 5-6 years that many branches of the media, specifically the music industry, have embraced the idea[of legalization]. Do you see maybe a double standard there?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> No, I don't think that at all. The media as a whole has been the lapdog of the drug warriors. They report things unchecked, they don't get alternate sources, they don't check the other viewpoint.   As far as the music industry... I don't think it's been an industry-wide thing. Some bands have expressed their support for drugs like marijuana.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> I know of two, Cypress Hill, which was a "rap" group and the other is the Dave Matthews Band.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Dave Matthews is very informed on the issue; he's been big into the hemp issue, industrial hemp, and just because someone has waken up to the fact that marijuana isn't such a bad thing, I don't think it is a conspiracy.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> I didn't mean to imply it was a conspiracy.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Well it's definitely not an industry wide thing.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> This is a personal question. What is the difference between hemp and cannibas? Actually that's probably a question that a lot of people want to know.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Well hemp is cannibas. Cannibas comes in many different forms, as far as plant wise. The plant people use to grow marijuana as a drug has a high content of THC and other canniboids. Industrial hemp actually cannot be used as a drug, it's just the plant form without canniboids, or very low concentrations. And it's an incredible thing, it can be used to make over 30,000 products. . .<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> The main thing I see it used for is clothing, and I'm assuming that. . .<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Nope. Paper, it's going to replace tree paper. It's going to replace fossil fuels, it's going to replace plastics. You can use it as biomass to convert it into a fuel.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> You mentioned cannaboids. Are those the chemicals that make marijuana a drug as opposed to a plant?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> The cannaboids. THC, CVD, CVC, I'm not exactly how many there are, but they're what causes the...<BR><DD><B>TE:</B> High...<BR><DD><B>SG:</B> Yeah.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> I'm just curious.<BR> (Writer's note: According to Mr. Gunther the brain has receptors that respond to cannibas. This is why it is non-addictive and non-fatal)<BR><DD><B>TE:</B> When you say legalization, do you mean total legalization?<BR> Unrestricted?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> There should be no criminal sanctions against adults purchasing marijuana. We should deal with underage marijuana use the same way we deal with underage drinking.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> In your opinion, what should the legal age be for marijuana use.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> 18.<BR><DD><B>TE:</B> Same as cigarettes?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Yeah.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> I know there's a tax on tobacco, and on alcoholic beverages. Do you think there should be some sort of marijuana tax?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Marijuana's a different thing to try to tax than alcohol or tobacco, just the fact that it's easy to produce it. What I think will happen is that commercial hemp products will be taxed, but citizens will be free to grow and use it at a local level as well. Sorta like vegetable gardens.<BR> <DD><B>TE: </B>I've also heard that marijuana has medicinal properties?<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Yeah. Marijuana is an incredible medicine. It's been used as a medicine by mankind for thousands of years. Right now it can be used to fight AIDS Wasting Syndrome, which is a condition caused by AIDS and the drugs used to fight AIDS. It causes people to lose all appetite and they actually waste away.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> Ugh!<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Marijuana is actually an appetite increaser, and it allows AIDS patients to...<BR><DD><B>TE:</B> Eat.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Yes. It's a great anti-nausea medicine. People who have chemotherapy, go through some AIDS treatments, can use marijuana to fight nausea. Marijuana can also be used to fight glaucoma, it has been used to reduce the size of tumors. It can be used as a muscle relaxant for for people who have diseases like MS. It's used in some countries for childbirth pains, headaches, migraines.<BR> <DD><B>TE:</B> Interesting. So when does the group meet.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Fridays, 4:20PM in the Ritz[basement of RIT's Student Alumni Union] we meet at 4:30 now.<BR><DD><B>TE: </B>Thank you for your time.<BR> <DD><B>SG:</B> Quite welcome.<BR>  </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/enunciate.html"> Other Enunciator Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/jd.html">James D'Angelo</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
