To facilitate that end, Christian corporations<A NAME="1.1"><A HREF="#1">&#134;</A></a> such as Proctor and Gamble, Johnson and Johnson, and Dow Chemical (in co-operation with and the fine makers of Norplant) have been producing what America wants, nay what America needs and what America has to have: soap. Antibacterial, moisturizing, deodorant, and glycerine soaps that come in a myriad of shapes, sizes, colours and flavours. <br><dd>The American obsession with cleanliness has brought us to where we are today...the world's only remaining Superpower acting as the UN's unwanted, unasked for police force. But it wasn't always that way. There was a time when the Monroe Doctrine (the edict from President Monroe, not the weekly newspaper of Monroe Community College in Rochester, NY) wasn't flagrantly violated simply because other world powers were more concerned with their own inpansion. Now, thanks to the explosion of the Maine,<A NAME="2.2"><A HREF="#2">&#131;</A></a> the Zimmerman Telegram, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and Robert Oppenheimer, the United States enjoys the honor of threatening and intimidating just about every other country. Why? We're cleaner, that's why! Just visit Europe and take a deep breath. Good God! It smells like a monkey house.<br><IMG width = 500 SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images8/1.1.gif"><br><dd>Ironically, it was the unusual smell encompassing Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries that helped make our country is what it is today. Of all the invaders arriving on the eastern shore of the New World, WASPS are taught that the most important were the Pilgrims; fleeing religious persecution, we're told, they arrived in the New World and drafted a document with lofty ideals that would later influence the United States' present Constitution.<br><dd>That's what we're told. The truth is more embarrassing than that.<br> <dd>Religious persecution was such a trendy concept in the 1500's that people just assumed that the Puritans were on the receiving end of the rather big sticks used at the time. Instead, these intrepid souls whose progeny would later make cleaning products that are 99 and 44/100 % pure were attempting to escape something more insidious and crippling to the spirit than religious intolerance: the funk of the land.<br> <dd>Beginning in the 1000's, King Henry I the Fouler was such a ripe bastard that few could draw close enough to contest his rule. Upon his death and subsequent superfunkafication, it was prophecised that the true King of England would reek to high heaven, thus identifying the proper heir. Over the next several hundred years the royal funk grew in power and intensity, eventually ruling the land while the various Kings were little more than figure-heads. By the time of King Henry the VIII, the Royal Funk ruled in his place while Henry was allowed to wallow away his days eating 20 pheasants in one sitting and changing his wives more often than his britches.<br><dd>You don't threaten your source of power. Not if you want the Funk to support you.<br><dd>Rebelling against the all pervasive smell that permeated hill and dale-and would sometimes knock on the peasant's doors and demand lodging for the night-the Puritans fled to the only place they could think of that was free: the New World. There, separated from the Funk by an ocean, they could begin their lives again.<br><dd>But after living like Germans for three months on the open sea, the people were ashamed and bewildered to discover that they too had created a funk all their own. Not only was it readily detectable to their desensitized noses, it was trimming the sail and mopping the deck by the third week out. Determined to leave the legacies<A NAME="3.3"><A HREF="#3">&#164;</A></a> of Jolly old England behind, the first thing they did upon landing at Plymouth rock was to draft the Mayflower Compact. But the second thing they did was to beat the living bejesus out of the funk by slamming it against the now famous Plymouth Rock.<A NAME="4.4"><A HREF="#4">&#135;</A></a><br><dd>After a good long bath the traumatized, but sweet smelling, settlers looked at the vast virgin landscape and felt something stir deep within them. For as far as the eye could see, the land was covered by ancient forests where strange and unknown animals ran. The air was clear and the water was pure.<br><IMG align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images8/1.2.gif"><br> <dd>John Carver, one of the first signers of the Mayflower Compact and particularly respected for his eloquent and subtle aromas, made an historic speech that forever set the course of our country:<br> <dd>"This place is a mess! We need to cut down these massive trees and make particle board! We need to invent asphalt and cover all the areas we would ever even think of walking on! And these people who have been crapping this place up all this time... we've been scouring a few of them with sand and they're still dirty. We need to exile them to places we'd never go!"<br> <dd>Although quite excitable, John Carver's words were heeded none the less.<br> <dd>What came next was described by Darwin as the survival of the cleanest. No one would court, or even bundle, with someone with poor personal hygiene (just like today. Sorry Seattle), and their offspring would be cleaner and more finicky.<A NAME="5.5"><A HREF="#5">&#165;</A></a> After generations of breeding out the dreaded, evil funk, the "Americans," as they so liked to call themselves (second only to "Masters of Time, the Universe and Deodorants"), developed weakened immune systems and a nagging irritation to histamine, which the body creates when it comes in contact with almost anything.<br><dd>In those pure, clean years, allergies were born.<br> <dd>Now, ours is an age where an American with a tapeworm is a pariah with a friend and allergies cripple people on a daily basis. Ironically, all these people who can't go a day without runny noses and puffy eyes could really do themselves a favor by occupying their immune system with a mild parasite.<A NAME="6.6"><A HREF="#6">&#167;</A></a><br><dd>Still, were stuck with our Puritanistic heritage like an historic case of the clap. It continues to permeate our culture, from congressional calls for family values to our obsessive need for cleanliness. So many things these days are labeled with cleanly looking "hypo-allergenic" labels for all those lazy blokes out there unwilling to live through a little mild discomfort that I'm waiting for the discrete signs on Sour Patch Kids saying they had ben ultra-pasteurized. Well I say to hell with it. Bring on the allergens! Oh, wait. Not the cats. I'm allergic to cats, but bring on everything else. Oh wait! Not goldenrod. I just can't deal with goldenrod pollen. NOW bring on the allergens. Give me something that will make my face swell like a puffer fish and stuffed with as much of the same toxic goodness.<br><IMG align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images8/1.3.gif"><br> <dd>I say that the age of hyper-allergenic products should now be upon us. The disintegration of the family unit has already happened; now it's time for the downfall of cleanliness. No more washing behind ears. No more employees washing hands before leaving restrooms. Enterics unite! It's time we as a nation got down off of our sanitized pedestal and mucked about in our own filth for a while. Why should poor Indians of third world nations have all the fun knee deep in crude oil, contracting deadly-petroleum allergies? We're the United States. We can do anything better. The good old U.S. of A, in conjunction with Disney Corp., should build theme parks for all those cute little tykes who want to scour the insides of Texaco's petroleum pits. Complete with animatronic dolls singing, "It's an OPEC World After All," Epcot could finally show us the future, coated in lead based, white paint, made in the US, sold abroad, and bought at a discount from China.<br> <dd>Disney's Oil World could feature the Lover's Pipeline, Consumer Waste Village, and special off limit areas for adults. Like the rooms of Chuck E. Cheese barred to the adult public, the Flake Room would be nothing more exotic than a warehouse filled with the remnants of human skin, being heartily consumed and excreted by the resident dust mites. In these rooms the little 'uns could roll about on the soft, hazy, misty stuff that seems to fill the room, and cling to every surface. To compete, Warner Brothers would install the more generic, but effective Pet Room, filled with a lower grade quality of cat and dog dander.<br><dd>In the meantime, we urge you to embrace the trend of organic remedies. Use maggots to remove unwanted, dead flesh, get workmen's compensation by protecting your pet hookworm, and fill your toilet with candiru. If any of you are tired of runny, achy eyes...swallow a tape worm. You'll feel better in the morning, we promise.<br> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><TABLE  WIDTH=500 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td><A NAME="1"><hr width=50% align=left></A><A NAME="2"><A NAME="3"><A NAME="4"><A NAME="5"><A NAME="6"></A></A></A></A></A><A HREF="#1.1">&#134; </A>Since God is American, and any American who is worth mentioning is Christian, God is Christian.

The bludgeoned funk so covered the stone, however, that most would pass out before actually planting a kiss. Tired of losing teeth and unwilling to give up the tradition, the right-thinking Puritans uprooted the stone, drug it 70km north, and scuttled it in Boston Harbor.<BR><A HREF="#5.5">&#165; </A> Over the centuries two distinct subspecies of Americans arose. The Red Blooded Americans (Homo sapien americanum ineptus) normally can tell stories of how one of their ancestors arrived at Ellis Island, sailed past Alcatraz, or snuck across the Rio Grande while the Blue Blooded Americans (Homo sapien americanum caeruleus), think that everyone's parents drive Opals, can include the name J.P Morgan in their strange, circular, family trees, and don't pay attention to stock notices that arrive in the mail. There is some contention between ethnographers and biologists as to whether the two subspecies actually represent distinctly new species. Though they fail to interbreed in the wild due to differences in mating rituals, their similarities indicate intraspecies variation, though the two groups could diverge at some point in the future.<BR><A HREF="#6.6">&#167; </A> Think of allergic reactions as the response of a bored immune system. Since humans evolved in an environment with parasites, distinct antibodies were created to fight them off. In our cleanly society, chances of having a parasitic infection are slim, but those antibodies are still kicking around with nothing to do. So, like bored children, the antibodies not doing anything eventually gang up on things like, oh, cat dander. So in this case, idle antibodies are the devil's plaything.<br> </td></tr></tr></table><P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/main.html">Other Main Article in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><table border><tr><tdvalign = top><font size = +1><b>Writer's Credits:<p></font size></b><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/kg.html">Kelly Gunter</A><br><dd>	<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A><br><dd>	<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/bb.html">Brian Barrett</A><p><b><font size = +1>Illustrator:</font size></b><p><dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/mm.html">Matthew Mesner</A><br></td></tr></table><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
