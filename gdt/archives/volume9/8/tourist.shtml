I don't intend to see it.  Daniel Day Lewis in a role where he struggles for his humanity, hope, life, etc????? Naaaahh.  Daniel Day Lewis would never make a film like that, now would he?  I hate movies!! They suck!  Hollywood sucks!  I suck for reviewing movies! You suck for reading my reviews!  Don't you have a free will of your own?  Can't you make the decision to watch the film yourself, without the prodding of pompous, inane critics like myself?  Guess not.<br>  <dd>I'm sorry.  Everything I have said above is a result of my lack of heroin.   Hold on while I tie off.  My roommates cooking  some good black tar  right now....gotta spike up.......just waiting for the needle to register..........aahhhhhhhhhhh.<br><dd>I love movies.  I know I'll love the Boxer, and I know you'll love it too. Life is good.  Just gonna crank up the Velvet Underground and void for a while.<br><dd>But seriously folks, I picked "The Boxer" this week because its a useful segue to a feature I want to have from time to time in TMR.  I call it "Tourist's Sunday Night Fights", and the way it works is simple. I know you've all played the versus game in one form or another, and I invite you to play along with me.   I'll begin this week, and I'll do all the work(pretend like we're in bed, you'll love it).  I shall present fights that I would like to see sometime in the near future.<br>  <dd>So you're in the civic center, surrounded by bookies, groupies, rednecks, violence junkies, and members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  The sodium arc lamps above you illuminate the big ring, the main event, the land of the muscle showdown.  Leaning back in your duct taped folding chair, you see the contenders take the corners.  The midget from Twin Peaks emerges from the crowd, produces a wireless microphone, and in his signature backwards-speak addresses the crowd -<br><dd>"Lehts  geeet redy to rooooooooock..."<br><dD>The crowd roars as the contest begins.  Headlining this evening's fight we have the following:<p> <B>FIGHT 1:</B><br><dd> Issac Hays & Issac Hanson vs Jim Henson & Chris Issak.<br><B>FIGHT 2:</B><br><dd>Encyclopedia Brittanica Boy (remember him?) vs Jim Cooke (the Sam Adams guy).<br><B>FIGHT 3:</B><br><dd>An Olympic Games Commentator vs An Oldies station DJ.<br><center>(The opponents sit at a table in the middle of the ring, boom mic headsets on, connected to loudspeakers.  Shovels and cans of mace are distributed to the audience and the winner is the one who is beaten senseless FIRST)</center><br> <B>FIGHT 4:</B><br> <dd>Morrisey with a razorblade vs Robert Smith with a shotgun.<br><center>(Attacking your opponent is optional in this fight)</center><br><B>FIGHT 5:</B><br><dd>Paula Cole &  Kareem Abdul Jabbar vs Paula Abdul & Nat King Cole.<br><B>FIGHT 6:</B><br> <dd>The fans at an Indigo Girls concert vs The fans at an Ani DiFranco concert.<br><B>FIGHT 7:</B><br> <dd>Jim Morrison with his peyote bag & Mister Rogers with his colostomy bag vs Van Morrison with his enema bag & Susan Sontag with her douche bag.<p><dd>WHO WILL WIN??? NOBODY KNOWS!!!  HAVE A SAFE EVENING AND PLEASE REFRAIN FROM THROWING THE FOLDING CHAIRS!<br><dd>And here's where I need your help.  Sure, I could come up with this shit all day long (this used to be a game to preserve sanity in extremely boring scenarios), but that's no fun.  We live in the "interactive" age, with strange things like "E-Mail."  Use it for Christ's sake!  I want you to get really loaded on your free-radical of choice and mail me with the fights you'd like to see.  I'll add the best ones to the next "Tourist's Sunday Night Fights".  Come on, it'll be swell.<br>  <dd>Send them to tourist@csh.rit.edu and I'll take care of the rest.  Thanks ahead of time, and dare to keep kids off black tar heroin!<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
