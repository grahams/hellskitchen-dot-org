This fish is actually a parasitic catfish and it probably isn't much of your concern to learn anything about this cute little fish, but it may come in handy someday.<br><dd>Normally this fish follows streams of warm water that flow from the gills of other, larger fish. When it finds a fish, it swims up into its gills and attaches itself with spines that protrude from its own gills. This causes the fish to bleed, and in turn gives the candiru a continuous, nutritious blood stream.<br><dd>Now, remember the good old days when you would visit your friend Tommy and you'd both play around in his little plastic kiddie pool? Do you remember the time when you were just sitting there, Tommy started smiling at you, and the water felt a little bit warmer? Well, in this type of situation, the candiru definitely would come looking for you. You may think to yourself, now how's a catfish going to attach itself to me? Here's where it gets fun.<br><dd>Stretching a total of about 40 - 60 millimeters long, and having a width of about 2.5 - 6 millimeters, the candiru can fit through the one opening that's most unpleasant. That's right boys and girls, your urethral opening. As you pee, the candiru starts to follow the pleasantly warm stream up to its source and begins chomping through the first opening it finds with its upper front teeth. Once it crawls its way up to its desired living ground, it ejects its spines and latches on to your honker with a power grip that far surpasses the one that Suzy Mitchell gave you in 9th grade. Now for women, like I said, choose an opening.<br><dd>The thought of just having a fish hanging around your tweeter isn't pretty, but how about removal of the fish? Of course you can't just rip the fish out, or burn it out, you have to have surgery. If you're rolling around in pain somewhere in the Amazon river, chances are that surgery might mean amputation. Basically, blockage of the urethral canal can be fatal.<br><dd>The only other two methods of removal that I know of are the Xaqua plant, and the buitach apple. I don't know much about these two, but I do know that they kill and actually dissolve the fish.<br> <dd>So, now that you know about the candiru, you might want to go to the Amazon river and try to catch a few. You could post a "Beware of Candiru" sign, rather than the lame "Please leave the `P' out of our `ool'" one in front of your pool. At least you know you'll be laughing when Tommy starts jumping around, screaming and holding himself like he really has to pee.<br> </multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/8/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/articles.html">Other Miscellaneous Articles in Volume 10</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/gb.html">Gad Berger</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
