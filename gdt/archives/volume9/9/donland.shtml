In a filing with the Donland Superior Court, Microsoft claimed that removal of Notepad from Windows 95 would render over 100 different Readme, log, and other text-based files "virtually unreadable."<br>	<dd>The filing further noted, "There is no way to remove Notepad and enable plain-text reading functionality without also degrading other functionality of Windows 95 because the exact same code provides both types of functionality." In a second filing, Microsoft objected to the appointment of Don as "extra-special master" in the lawsuit over evidence of an e-mail which shows that Don is biased against the Redmond, Washington based company.<br> 	<dd>The alleged e-mail, which was sent to a member of the DJD, read "Bill Gates is a ninny. Pass it on."<br> 	<dd>Microsoft's filing stated that "The position of 'extra-special master' is inappropriate for Don. His unnecessary name-calling of Mr. Gates was uncalled for and unprovoked, and we feel he is no longer 'extra-special.' We request that his title be changed to the more generic 'ordinary master.'"<br> <dd>	"What in the world does all that mean?" asked one Donland developer. "It's just more of Microsoft's legalese to confuse the issue. And let's face it, Bill Gates <U>is</U> a ninny."<br> <dd>	Don refused to comment on the "ninny" e-mail.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/donland.html"> Other Donland Articles in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/dr.html">Don Rider</A><br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
