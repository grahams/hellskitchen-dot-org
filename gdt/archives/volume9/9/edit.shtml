It just so happens that the domestic goldfish has the capacity to remember exactly one lap around the bowl. Thus for the goldfish, life is continually new and amazing. During each lap, a goldfish more or less thinks, 'This is new! This is new! Wow, this is new!' Those poor goldfish whose attention spans allow them to realize they are merely swimming in circles simply close their gills and suffocate themselves to escape the boredom of their existence. Thus the fittest survive."<br><center><font size = -1>"The Old-Folk's Home," 7 Jan 1996,<br> 		<I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I></center></font size><p><dd>"I've jokingly said to friends that goldfish have been bred to have memories just long enough to recall a single lap around their spherical universe. Those cursed with the skill of memory would live mind bogglingly boring lives and eventually kill themselves.<br><dd>"This explains why many goldfish only survive a few days once brought home. They were adapted for aquariums larger than what they were given.<br><dd>"For the survivors, their life is one filled with fascination and wonder. Every sight is the first. Every exploration of the sunken ship or Atlantian castle is unprecedented. To them, everything is new."<br>	<center><font size = -1>"Editor's Note:Art of Forgetting"<br>			18 January, 1998<br>			<I>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</I><br></center></font size></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/9/index.html">Other Article in the Same Issue </A>-<A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/edit.html"> Other Editorials in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/sh.html">Sean Hammond</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
