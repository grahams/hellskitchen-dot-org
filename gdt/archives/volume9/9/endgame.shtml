Toward the edge, near a stand of poplars washed out and faded by a light mist, an old bucket stood lonely vigil. Left behind by a forgetful child, its handle askew where the elements had breached its armor and given it cancer, the galvanized grigori sat in silent witness to the trees and grass. Within its pitted and fouled interior, water pooled, offering sanctuary to mosquitoes in the warmer months, and slime as the year progressed. Currently it was the final resting place of a field mouse that had fallen in while getting a drink. For a long time the panicked creature had scratched at the sides, desperately trying to get out of the silent vessel. But the water was too still, the sides too smooth, and now the creature softly floated in the stygian fluid.<br> <IMG width = 25% align = right SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images9/1.1.gif"><br><dd>It had rained in the night, and water still rolled along the barren tree branches in its winding course to the earth. With metronomic regularity came the plopping sound of water drops captured by the bucket; one more diversion before reaching the soil, the rock, the hidden river far under the land. On the verge of overflowing, the sodden and decomposing body of the rodent gently rested against the side of the bucket, finally on the verge of escaping in death that which had claimed it in life.<br> <dd>From the sky came the clamor of voices like thunder. Great horns brayed and a cacophony of sound assaulted the ground. As the noise grew louder, the bucket began to vibrate. The moist and lichen covered branch which the water filled bucket partially rested upon offered poor support and with little ceremony, the bucket fell onto its side sending the tuberculoidal water across the already sodden earth. Unaware of its freedom, the mouse stay where it lay.<br><dd>As the bucket stopped its motion, the source of the commotion appeared above the trees from the east and descended to the field. Like men, but greater in size and stature, the beings could be nothing but the focus of any landscape. Their very existence made everything around them fade from view, become pastel, less real.<br><dd>Angels made their way across the open spaces and walked in the world of men unafraid.<br><dd>If the bucket were sentient, it would have immediately felt kinship for these divinely inspired creatures. In the field before it were the Watchers-those cast from Heaven and bound to the Earth, cursed to always be among, but never of, the world. All about the field, despite what the senses revealed, the impression of eyes and wings in unfathomable numbers was overwhelming.<br><dd>Legend had conditioned Man to expect leather winged demons with horns and cloven feet, but the Watchers were beautiful to the point of pain. Surely the Army of God would be so much more.<br><dd>In the distance other angels could be seen in pursuit. Far to the east the Heavenly Host had routed the demons and were chasing them across the globe. The End Time had come and the rebellion would finally be finished. The demons regrouped in the field, their forces in disarray, confused. How best to deal with the coming onslaught?<br> <dd>As their attackers appeared over the trees, the over-riding impression was one of sameness. The Host were so similar to the demons that it became impossible to distinguish between the blessed and fallen. Only their movements betrayed them. The angels moved with fluid grace, assured of their victory, while the demons possessed a ferocity that comes only when one has nothing to lose.<br><dd>When one is fighting for one's existence.<br><dd>As the angels descended, Michael spoke to the legions of demons before him.<br><dd>"Join me. Together we can end this destructive conflict."<br><dd>As though choreographed, the demons whined, "I'll never join you!"<br><dd>"It is your destiny."<br><dd>"No!" they screamed and went on the offensive.<br><dD>Bagels, pillows, and sillystring filled the autumn sky that was already whispering of winter. In reply, Michael and his followers opened with volleys of matzo, Nerf weapons, and oompah bands. Above the noise of accordions and banjoes, the voice of the Serpent could be heard.<br><dd>"Apple core!"<br> <dd>"Baltimore!"<br> <dd>"Who's my friend?"<br> <dd>To which the imps shouted as one voice, "HIM!" pointing to Gabriel, blowing his bass kazoo.<br><dd>Flying true, the core of the fruit flew, smashing into the middle of the Angel of Jazz's forehead, sending his horn flying.<br> <dd>With a cry, the fallen ones rejoiced. Their morale renewed, they advanced on the enemy. Intensifying their onslaught by employing their arsenals of serendipity, random number generators, and lots and lots of hard mathematic computations, the angels fell back. With another cry, the demons closed. But from their flank rose the cherubs. At the front Cupid, a morbidly obese infant with grey, unseeing eyes, began to unleash wave after wave of Conversation Heart tipped toothpicks into the ranks of the demons. The air was filled with flashes of Be Mine, Fax Me, and You're Cute and the demons roared out in frustration at being caught from behind. Other cherubs, ducking to avoid being struck by the randomly shot arrows of Cupid, carried sparklers and bubbles. The winged infants came from on high, bombing the demon's positions with circus peanuts and candycorn. The howls of the wretched reverberated across the land.<br><IMG  width = 100% SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images9/1.2.gif"><br><dd>On the field, Cupid's weapons were having their effect. Confused demons cast volleys of Immaculate Conception, pinwheels, and gyros into the sky, against their enemies on the ground, against themselves. Many suddenly found themselves pregnant with a taste for dill pickles.<br> <dd>Rallying His forces, Lucifer began waving His flashlight in an attempt to make it work. Close behind, Azriel arrived to help his comrade-in-arms with new batteries.<br><dD>"Work, damn you!" came His cry as He struck the case against His crippled leg. In that instant, the light bringer's million watt bulb burst into life, blinding all around Him, causing several cherub squadrons to careen wildly off course, crashing into and incinerating nearby trees.<br><dd>From the forest suddenly burst troops of satyrs and nymphs, led by Pan. Eyes rolling in carnal lust, minds rolling in carnal thought, he and his compatriots immediately leap to the aid of the fallen ones and begin to hump the legs of the androgynous Host of God.<br><dd>Disturbed by the desperate grunting and grinding of the hairy creatures, along with their all too Earthy fecal smell, the Host fell back into a trap laid by legions of Fae marines. Thousands of spring snakes and Chinese finger cuffs leapt into the sky, incapacitating scores of angels. Seeing his chance, Puck leapt into the fray, fixing the Chinese fingercuffs covering the field to the senseless fingers of angels. Whole battalions of the Host had to be removed from the field of battle thanks to the bravery of Robin Goodfellow.<br><IMG width = 35% align = left SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images9/1.3.gif"><br><dd>Not expecting Gaia's children to help the Rebels, the battle had suddenly turned. In a desperate attempt to restore morale and go on the offensive, the angel's grenadiers donned gas masks and launched volleys of allergens into the enemy ranks. The sound of sneezing and nose blowing was deafening, leveling oaks and making willows whisper, while sucking the air out of the lungs of those closest to the blast zone.<br> <dd>In retaliation Semyaza, extracting himself from the swarming pile of mortal women sent to distract him, called down plagues of blueberry candy canes and angel hair spaghetti. Caught unaware, Uriel and Thelesis were buried under torrents of pasta and sugary sweetness.<br><dd>Unseen by the combatants, four horsemen had arrived from the compass points and bound the field. Pestilence silently picked at acne on his face and absently swatted at flies while Famine busily scoured the field for the Conversation Hearts that had missed their mark.<br> <dd>"Mmmm! Cookie good!"<br><dd>War had brought Athena with him and the two were psychoanalyzing each other by saying the first words that came to mind, and Death was busy discussing the importance of diversifying one's portfolio when investing in the futures market with the translucent spirit  of the dead mouse....<p><dd>A<FONT SIZE =-1>ND THE MORAL OF THIS LITTLE STORY</FONT SIZE>?
