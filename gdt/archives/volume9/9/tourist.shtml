There's a reason for things becoming unpopular as the years progress.  Just look at "Birdman" cartoons during the Cartoon Network's "Toonami"-that sucks even more than it sucked back in the sixties.<br> <dd>I didn't expect much from this film as I sauntered into the theatre on Valentine's Day.  I went to see it as sort of a tribute to how much love sucks and how dumb Valentine's Day is. But, as a "Everything I've ever done, I've done for you..." film (see also "Some Kind of Wonderful," "Miracle Beach," "Say Anything," and other cheezy 80's flicks) it was on the ball, with Gwyneth Paltrow as a fantastic bitch.<br>  <IMG align = center SRC="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/images/vol9/images9/tourist.gif"><br><dd>Man was she cold!  Just what I needed for the dumbest fuckin' holiday of the year... next to Columbus Day of course.<br>  <dd>Anyway, the thing that I noticed was its employment of the "can-i-paint-you-naked?" motif, which brings in the bucks by showing some skin, yet remaining "tasteful" enough for all audiences (see also "Titanic," "As Good As It Gets," and "Sirens").  This gave me a nice semi just as the film was getting a bit boring.  Thumbs up.<br>	<dd>What bothered me was that the film didn't employ the other well known motif of "can-I-make-your-penis-talk?" Let's face it.  True love is not dying for that person, or devotion beyond all rational thought.  True love is not roses, or chocolate, or exotic underbriefs.  True love is waking up and looking down to see your penis being manipulated like a little fleshy muppet, by someone other than yourself.  You know the relationship is serious when you're sitting there, and you have this dying urge to grab your significant other's tweeter and make it say any of the following:<br><dd>"Ladies and Gentleman.  I am the President of the United States.  I am not a crook."<br><dd>"Heeeellloooo!  My name is Peter!  Hello up there. I would like a salad!"<br><dd>"It's so cute!  Duhdho bubba, duhdho bubba" (similar to when addressing an infant child).<br><dd>In the film, this proved to be the most obnoxious oversight. If instead of saying "I want you inside me...", Gwyneth had ripped the sheets off the bed and exposed Ethan's flaccid schlong, grabbed it, yanked it, and said, "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Duhdho bubba," I would have been able to suspend my disbelief easier.  Other than that, the film was nice.  It was leaps and bounds better than that goddamn book that everyone was forced to read in the 9th grade.  But it goes to show you that sex sells. If they ever make "Oliver Twist" into a Turkish prison sodomy film, you know that I'll be the first one at the door.<p><dd><font size = -1>P.S.  I've gotten a bunch of excellent matches for the next Sunday Night Fights.  Keep em coming!  Its nice to know you're wasting as much time as I have on that kind of shit.<br></multicol><br></td></tr></table> <P><hr><center><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/9/index.html">Other Articles in the Same Issue</A> - <A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/tourist.html">Other Tourist Reviews in this Volume</A><br>Other Volumes -<A HREF="../../../welcome.html" target="_parent">Main Menu</A> </nobr></font size></center><p><font size =+1><b>Writer:<br></b></font size>	<dd><A HREF="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~diablo/gdt/archives/volume9/authors/ss.html">Sean Stanley</A> <br><!--#include virtual="/~diablo/gdt/includes/issuefooter.inc"--></body></html>
