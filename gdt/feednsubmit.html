We love to hear from our readers...be it fan mail, hate mail, submissions, or suggestions.<p>
We're especially interested in finding people interested in doing weekly columns or comics.<p>

Though Gracies Dinnertime Theatre is read in paper form throughout Rochester, New York thanks to <a href="../welcome.html">Hell's Kitchen</a> and in its electronic form by individuals all over the United States and around the world (well, at least in England, Bulgaria, and Israel). If you have something you'd like to share, be it a satirical or more artistically creative piece, send it along to us.<p>
We print both literary and graphic works, though we refuse to print top ten lists of humor akin to fart jokes. <p>

So if you have something to share, or want to let us know how you feel about something we've written, feel free to get in touch with us.<p>

You can get in touch with us through e-mail or snail mail<p>
