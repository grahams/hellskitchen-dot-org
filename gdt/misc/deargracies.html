<TITLE>What is Dear Gracies</TITLE><BODY BACKGROUND="../images/bg/bg2.gif"><center><H2>What is "Dear Gracies?"</H2></center><body>Well, 'Dear Gracies and Hetties' is a weekly publication put out by the two main dining facilities on the <A HREF="http://www.rit.edu" target="out">RIT</A> campus, for which it is named after.  One is Grace Watson - affectionately referred to as '<A HREF="gracies.html">Gracies</A>' and the other is the Hettie Shumway Dining Commons, or DC.<P>In an effort to constantly improve upon service, 'Dear Gracies and Hetties' provides an outlet for students to voice their opinions on the dining establishments, suggesting 'better pizza' and 'less hair in the food' as among the hottest of topics.  These thoughts and suggestions are then culminated in the 'Dear Gracies and Hetties' newsletter format to be distributed to the masses, such that they too can agree, crying out 'By golly, YES!  That fellow student is right!  The pizza SHOULD be better!'<P>'Dear Gracies and Hetties' is in no way affiliated with 'Gracies Dinnertime Theatre'...  with exception to the fact that the latter was both celebrated and accosted in the former upon numerous occasions.<P><center><A HREF="../welcome.html">Main Menu</A></center><P><P><P><P><ADDRESS>met6966@ritvax.isc.rit.edu</ADDRESS>
