<TITLE>Kerstin Gunter</TITLE><body><center><table><tr><td><center><IMG SRC="../images/misc/kerstin.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td><center>Kerstin Gunter</center></td></tr></table></center><P>Kerstin is the eldest sister of <A HREF="../responsible.html">Kelly Gunter</A>. She was also head editor of <A HREF="reporter.html">The Reporter</A> news-mag when GDT was trying to get published. GDT was rejected. <P>In a later conversation with her younger sister, Kelly, explaining why GDT was refused, she reportedly said, "It's really funny. It's your sense of humor...we just can't print it."<P>Apparently if GDT had rewritten the first issue to make it sufficiently inoculous, they would have printed it. Well we did change the first issue; we made it more offensive, and then started printing them ourselves.<P><ADDRESS>kkg8006@ritvax.isc.rit.edu</ADDRESS>
