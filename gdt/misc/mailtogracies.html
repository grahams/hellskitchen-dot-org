Not only was the publication officially banned, but the editors were repeatedly called in to explain why issues were still appearing in the dining hall.<P>Well, we're bitter. Not only were (and still are) we being censored by having issues confiscated, but we were deprived of amusing the wallowing hordes, as was our original intent.<P>Help us out by sending an e-mail message to The Powers That Be at Gracies, telling them how much you want GDT to be allowed into the dining commons.<P><center><A HREF="http://www.rit.edu/Network/ISC/Helpdesk/Full_ASK/food_service.html">Follow this link to get in touch with Gracies<P><IMG SRC="../images/vol1/gpolice.gif"></A></center><p><center><A HREF="../welcome.html">Main Menu</A></center></font size><ADDRESS>sth8884@ritvax.isc.rit.edu</ADDRESS></html>
