More recently, I have found it to be a truely substandard publication not worth the ink used to print. They have a <A HREF="http://www.rit.edu/~reporter" target="_parent">web site</A> (finially). You can see for yourself what I mean.<p>Here's an except from an editorial I pulled out of their <B>12 May, 1995</B> issue (I think this sums things up nicely):<P><P><hr><H1>well, well, well...</H1><font size=+1><dd>Reporter magazine has seen better days. At least that is the impression I have been given lately; at our editorial staff meetings, and by more than one student. It has been brought to my attention that a number of people have complained about the magazine saying it looks horrible. Many have said that the articles are unreadable. One guy came up to me the other day and said that he had a problem with one of the layouts. I'll quote him (I thought this was great)..."[the articles] look like an abortion on paper."
