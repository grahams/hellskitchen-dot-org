<font size=+2><b>What is Hell's Kitchen?</b></font>

<BR>

Hell's Kitchen is kind of esoteric. It is a story swap between various member organizations. Member organizations agree to allow other member organizations to reproduce their material (usually written).  In exchange, they are given the right to reproduce and promote material from other members.<p>

The publications under the name Hell's Kitchen are member organizations which choose to call themselves Hell's Kitchen in exchange for more say in the organization.<p>

<font size=+2><b>How much does it cost to be a member of Hell's Kitchen?</b></font>

<BR>

It's a free service for small organizations. It's hard enough putting something of quality out for the public; Hell's Kitchen is supposed to make it easier by providing a larger audience and more material to choose from.

<font size=+2><b>Since Hell's kitchen is free, I can print articles from Hell's Kitchen without asking, right?</b></font>

<BR>

You need to join Hell's Kitchen to have the right to reproduce our stuff.  The original authors/artists will definitely want to know  -- and have a right to know -- where their work is appearing.

<font size=+2><b>What's the catch?</b></font>

<BR>

There is no catch.  Hell's Kitchen began because one small publication in Rochester, NY had a hard time finding enough quality material each week. Since then it has grown to potentially include theatre groups, radio stations, web site, and just about any other creative group you can think of.<p>

It's all about reaching a wider audience, making things easier for one another, and having fun. There are organizations similar to Hell's Kitchen for the professional press, and even for college newspapers, but not for more creative groups.<p>

We know (believe me, we know) that most small creative groups have very limited budgets. That's why it costs nothing to join Hell's Kitchen. With any luck, as Hell's Kitchen grows, it will receive more sponsors, meaning Hell's Kitchen can help its members.
