<font size=+4>H</font size>ell's Kitchen was concieved of by Sean Hammond and Kelly Gunter in early 1995 shortly after they began printing <i>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</i>. Thought of as a "satire exchange," the two attempted to contact college based satire publications on the web to make their pitch. No one replied.<p>





&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the next year <i>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</i> divided, and divided again. By 1996 a total of three associated publications were located in Rochester and printing together. In time, it was recognized that an umbrella organization was needed.
<p>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The name Hell's Kitchen was chosen for a number of reasons, mostly pertaining to in-group references:

<ul>

<li><i>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre</i> often made reference to a fictional organization named Hell Inc. which had many subsideraries.

<li>All the sister groups had titles dealing with food (<i>Gracies Dinnertime Theatre, Melancholy Predator, 10:1 Cereal Delusions</i>).

<li>Hell's Kitchen, NYC was the stomping grounds of a number of authors, as well as the fictional location of the Wyland Building in Ayn Rand's <i>Fountainhead</i>.

</ul>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The list goes on, but I won't.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As other groups joined Hell's Kitchen, the nature of the organization slowly changed until it became what it was first envisioned as: a story swap organization working to help small organizations reach larger audiences.
