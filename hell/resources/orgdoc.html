Though the Kitchen's Org. Doc. might appear to be an improvised document, a great deal of thought and research has gone into its creation and it is currently in its <U>ninth</U> revision. Though this may seem excessive, each change was made to address a specific problem which arose, or a philosophic/sociological concept we wanted addressed.<p>

The present F3ODFHK has drawn on several sources for inspiration:

<li><A HREF="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/aunchart.htm">United Nations Charter</A>
<li><A HREF="http://www.axess.com/mohawk/constitution.html">Gayanashagowa</A> (The constitution of the Iroquois Nations)
<li><A HREF="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/avalon.htm
">Avalon Project</A> - Lots of historical documents from the Code of Hammarabi to present day charters
<li><A HREF="http://www.urich.edu/~jpjones/confinder/const.htm

<font size=-1>A little history: The part of the Kitchen's organizing document which is most confusing is the official name of the document: "The Far from Frivolous Organizing Document for Hell's Kitchen," more commonly abbreviated to F3ODFHK (pronounced "fod-fuk")<p>

The document was named during the Kitchen's correspondence with  the United States Internal Revenue Service. While applying for non-profit status, the Kitchen was told "...a frivolous Constitution, which is how we interpret your existing Constitution, certainly has a place in the organization's activities since you are an organization one of whose purposes is satire.... We will require a more traditional organizing document...."</center>
