<font size=-1><B> Hell's Kitchen is no longer permitted to inform readers over the web that they can send donations to Hell's Kitchen.</B></font size>

</center>



<p>

<font size=-1>Nor can we let readers know that in the past</font size> <font size=+2>the organizations that make up Hell's Kitchen have paid for themselves mainly through grants and donations made by the dedicated staff members of each organization, and that now <U>you</U> can help support Hell's Kitchen.</font size><p>



<font size=-1>It is absolutely forbidden for us to use this page to let people know that </font size><font size=+2>when Hell's Kitchen receives donations of $9 or more the donor will receive the most current volume of combined publications from Rochester, NY (averaging between 9 and 14 issues).</font size><p>



<font size=+2>Hell's Kitchen is a non-profit, not for profit, 501(c)(3) group</font size><font size=-1>, but we can't even mention that</font size> <font size=+2>we rely on supporters like <U>you</U> to allow us to help our members continue to produce uncensored, intelligent satire and creative fiction in an age when "print is dead."</font size> <p>



I suppose we could say that all donations are spent on printing and that we hope to reach a point when we can start to pay our staff members, but we won't say it because we want to avoid trouble. <p>



<font size=-1>In no shape, way, or form could we say that</font size> <font size=+2>if you'd like to make a donation, you should send your name, address and a cheque or money-order to:<br>



<B>Hell's Kitchen<br>

472 French Rd<br>

Rochester, NY 14618<p></B></font size>
