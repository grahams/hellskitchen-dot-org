<font size=+2>Because Yahoo has failed to change how this site is listed despite 2 years of submitting change forms, we have moved.<p>
You can find us at <a href="http://www.hellskitchen.org">www.hellskitchen.org</a><p>
As soon as Yahoo makes the necessary changes (if ever) we will not use this site.<p>

If you wait you'll be taken there....
