The book was banned in 1930 by by a provincial Chinese governor, who declared that "Animals should not talk like humans." Additional problems with the text include the rapidly changing size of a young girl, a perennially late rabbit, and both a cat and an insane milliner who would become emblems of the pro-drug movement in the United States. His talking animals got the governor in a snit, and opened a whole new realm of possibility to small, devious children everywhere. Hooray!
