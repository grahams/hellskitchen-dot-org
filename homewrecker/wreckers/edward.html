Kelley served as a 'sensitive' in John Dee's work with the occult. Dee himself is pictured above; images of Kelley proved impossible to obtain. Dee and Kelley worked together, both in Prague as researchers and in the service of Queen Elizabeth, as her royal astrologers. Despite his vast knowledge of the occult, Dee found that he was unable to communicate with the spirit realm and relied on Kelley as a medium. This arrangement served well until Kelley informed Dee that the spirits had told him that Kelley and Dee ought to share everything, including their wives. Both men's marriages were dissolved shortly afterward.</font size></td></tr></table><p><hr><A href="../">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="welcome.html">List of Homewreckers</A></center>
