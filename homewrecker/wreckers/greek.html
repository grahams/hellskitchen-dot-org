The women lament the absence of their husbands and lovers, who return from war only for brief conjugal visits. Under Lysistrata's direction, they pledge abstinence until the men agree on a peace treaty. Fighting comes to a speedy end and the men return to the now open arms of their wives and honeybunnies. (Thanks to Kristen Allen for the story of Lysistrata.)</font size></td></tr></table><p><hr><A href="../">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="welcome.html">List of Homewreckers</A></center>
