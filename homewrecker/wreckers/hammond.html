Hammond is the only person, except for perhaps his co-editor and head scratcher Kelly Gunter, who is in direct contact with the all-powerful Susan, secretary to C. Diablo. Check out the Hell's Kitchen website for pictures of Susan. He asked to be the homewrecker of the week about a month and a half ago, but has yet to kill himself and his children using a gas oven, or cause the breakup of a band or any long-term health problems. He did succeed in changing the size of Hell (and BOY is the big guy pissed) and facilitated the escape of the editor of the <A HREF="../../predator">Melancholy Predator</A> by driving him to the train station. He also rode around in a Ford Bronco decorated with the blade assemby from a blender for most of the summer.</font size></td></tr></table><p><hr><A href="../">Main Menu</A> - <A HREF="welcome.html">List of Homewreckers</A></center>
