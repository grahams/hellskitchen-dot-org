The Faerie Kitchen

<br>Andrea Chrisman<p>


It was just before nine o'clock and the full moon was rising 


menacingly over the forest in the corner of Glendale. The moon 


spread itself over the Seelie house, an old Victorian cast in the 


shadows of arthritic bony-fingers cast from the darkest pitch 


of the forest trees. The sinking mortar gave the appearance of 


a grave marker:  only one reflection of its age.  Cracked paint, 


molded window frames and missing shutters added to its sinister 


look. From a small round window on the third floor, a curtain 


pulled back and  revealed a face peering out into the night at the 


four children standing by the rusted iron gate. From the  bird's 


eye view the four were dwarfed by the strangling shadows in 


the yard. Had the four looked up to see through the window, 


they would have seen a hunched back, and silver hair on an old 


woman with a grin that showed far too many teeth. The curtain 


drew quickly back again to hide the hideous form as the children 


stood in the gateway of the property.


<p>"Oh, go ahead. Knock, I dare you."


<p>Martin had long black hair that extended just past his ears 


and was dressed entirely in black clothes with a cape that was too 


long for him. It dragged on the ground behind and as he coaxed his 


peers to knock at the door of the Seelie's home, he garbled words 


between his plastic fangs. His eyes seemed to pierce Molly's gaze 


as he grinned slightly.


<p>Molly turned her head to the house to avoid the stare and saw 


it camouflaged against that forest backdrop. Some of its trees 


littered the front lawn at odd angles spotting the area with ominous 


shapes draped over the structure's eaves.


<p>Shuddering in the chill of the evening, she turned back to the 


three friends who stood about her.  Janet stood fidgeting, tugging 


at Martin's arm, begging him to leave.  "Don't do this."  She said to 


him with a tone of desperation.  She was holding the length of her 


dress as she moved down to grab Martin's hand in hers, an attempt 


to pull him from the house and his mission to cajole his victims.


<p>"No, I really want to see this."


<p>"You know what happened the last time, please, let's just leave."


<p>"I think they're chicken."


<p>Molly turned her gaze back to Tom, who was as new to Glendale 


as she.  Though he was, perhaps two months more seasoned, he did 


not know who lived in the house, nor the horrible rumors that had 


been spread about its inhabitants. Had he heard, his reach would surely 


not have extended to take Molly's hand in the dark glow of that Hallow's 


Eve.  His stormy gray eyes fell upon her in a moment of courageousness 


and both moved toward the house up the cobblestone walk.  The wrought 


iron gate slammed behind them which caused both to startle and stop 


their slow procession forward.  The wind kicked up enveloping them in 


an icy blast of cold and both clung tighter to each other's hand.  The shivers 


turned to bumps climbing arms through the neck causing bones to quake.  


Somehow, the two will still drawn to the house, with its heavy oak door.  


With one look back to Janet and Martin, they continued cautiously to the 


door.


<p>All at once the two on the street shrieked and took heel, running 


towards the center of town as the door flung open and three women 


stood on the porch.  All were grinning with pointing teeth that filled 


their mouths.  


<br>"Greetings."  said the tallest and the youngest of the three to the left. 


<p>"Salutations."  came from the old hobbly creature on the right.


<p>"Come in for some tea" said the middle as all three stepped to the side.  


Molly and Tom looked at each other with fear, but felt somehow compelled 


to follow the order.  As they entered the doorway the three women turned 


their backs to the street revealing three sets of wings drawn taught against 


their backs and stretching down to the bottom of their dresses.


<p>The heavy oak door slammed into its cracked frame.  "It doesn't close 


all the way if we do not slam it" said the oldest of the three.  They were 


standing in line youngest to oldest, tallest to shortest in front of the doorway 


through which they all entered.  The entrance was of an old, dimly lit 


cathedral with a dark tiled floor appearing to sing of the Renaissance.  


The hallway into the house led to a winding wooden staircase that wound 


around a towering form, disappearing into pitch blackness.  "Please, after 


you" said the old woman again this time pointing with a crooked arthritic 


finger under her bent nose.  Seeing their escape blocked, they walked 


slowly towards the first incline to avoid showing the hostesses their rising 


fears.


<p>Their footfalls echoed through the arch.  Looking up, the two friends 


say stars and the full moon rising slowly through an enormous skylight.  


Tom tripped into Molly, and as both attempted to rise they felt the cold 


breath of ice across their backs.  The three were following closely behind.  


Close enough to chew them with those grotesque teeth.


<p>"Be Careful children.  We wouldn't want you to bruise that pale 


white flesh."


<p>The youngest was offering an arm to lift Tom.  He accepted the 


assistance and with a forceful lift he was on his feet.  Molly sat on the 


step brushing her jeans clean, and then she, too rose up and stared at the 


women.  Six jet black eyes pierced her skin and make her avert her gaze 


back to Tom.  "Are you okay?"


<p>The three hovered about her, almost floating, urging her on with 


silent stares.  She turned and followed Tom's heels with the ominous 


looming figures at her back.  They made no sounds with their steps 


because the stairs were now carpeted.


<p>All came to an abrupt halt on the landing in a warmly lit 


country kitchen.  There was a table in the middle of the room set 


for five with saucers and cups for tea, flowered plates with forks 


and a spice cake sitting boldly in the middle of a brightly colored 


table cloth that matched the rosy flowers on the flatware.  To the 


left was a gas stove with a teapot piping its readiness through the 


room, and a saucepan filled with a warming glaze for the cake.


<p>The three women walked into the kitchen and attended their 


work, the youngest could now be seen with long brownish green 


colored hair, a pale face, and unusually tall figure that stood even 


above Tom's six feet.  She glided over to the saucepan, stirring its 


contents with a whisk for a moment, then turning to pour it over 


the spice cake.  She had unfolded her wings a bit in her more 


comfortable surroundings and they revealed themselves to almost 


resemble those of a ladybug, sheathed in a harder shell to protect 


them.


<p>The middle aged of the three took the teapot from the stove 


and poured its contents into a kettle with a variety of sweet spices 


and tea leaves.  She introduced herself as Grimalken Seelie, mother 


of Eve and daughter of Morgana.


<p>While Grimalken introduced the three ladies, the old woman 


folded napkins into animal shapes, though it could never be repeated 


by any mortal.  She beckoned the two to take place by their shape: a 


hare for Molly and a deer for Tom.  Three others sat shaped on each 


place setting--Morgana took her place by the raven, Grimalken by 


the cat, and Eve by the serpent.


<p>Conversation flowed with ease from that point on.  Though the 


two friends were apprehensive, the three women showed them only 


the kindest hospitality.  Entirely expecting their tea to be poisoned, they 


watched the three women drink theirs first, and they allowed only 


listening.  The three women shared many secrets, but the children 


nothing except perhaps their names.  It became quite clear to them 


that the three women were not the evil haunting people that the town 


seemed to make of them.  


<p>"What happened here before that made our friends so 


afraid when you answered the door?"


<p>"Of that we cannot tell you, only that we were not responsible 


for what had happened."  Explained Eve replied to that comment 


"We only know that a young man was torn apart on Hallow's Eve 


for trespassing someplace he should not have been.  He did not know 


any better, but ignorance means nothing to them anymore.  They 


have turned to cruel creatures intent on destroying the man who 


imprisoned them.  There are a few among them who dare to rebel 


against the head mistress, but only so few that they could not help 


that poor boy.  He was only thirteen.  He stumbled to a place he 


should not have been."


<p>"That's sufficiently vague," said Molly feeling more confident.  


"I didn't think there really was any story.  I thought it was all just made 


up to scare us in school.  But did Martin do the same thing?"


<p>"Yes, I believe he did, but not this home.  Perhaps he thought 


it would produce more extravagant a show because our house shows 


its age.  I do not know his motivations to sending you here, but you 


have been lucky."


<p>"Fed well at least," sighed Tom with a sigh of contentedness.


<p>"we'd better be going.  It's been really cool, and I am kinda glad 


we came.  I hope we meet again." said Molly rising from the table and 


pushing in her chair politely.  "You can always call us.  We're both listed."  


<p>"Perhaps we shall see you again Molly Flanders and Tom Spacek." 


replied Grimalken.  "Perhaps this very night.  Beware the woods at night."


<p>"Thanks, but we aren't even really going near there.  We'll just 


do some trick-or-treating on our ways home.  We'll be fine."  said Tom.


<p>They said their good-byes and parted company with their hostesses, 


making their own way toward the center of town, feeling confident 


with themselves that they had done well, and would return to school 


the next morning to tell Janet and Martin horrifying stories of the three 


women in the house.  They were determined to keep the secret for 


themselves, not sharing the wonderful hospitality of the three with any 


of the inhabitants of that provincial little town.  They made their pact 


and shook hands on it, continuing on their way stopping at random 


houses to beg for their candy.  


<p>When they came to the little Baptist Church that marked the center 


of Glendale, they decided to visit the priest who lived in the home just 


next door.  It was bright white with a white iron fence.  Upon it were 


painted red ribbons tied in bows, and bushes surrounding that fence 


with bright red berries.  These were the types of bushes parents warn 


their children about when they see the birds pecking the fruit from its 


branches.  


<p>There was a porch light on, glaring at them like a spotlight so 


they looked down upon the ground as they entered through the gate. 


It locked behind them and they noticed on the ground that it was 


covered with four leaf clovers. "Whoa." said Tom in disbelief. I don't 


think I've ever seen anything like this before." "You're right, it's weird." 


They continued foreword, and saw to their left a birdbath with a 


fountain. The property was well-maintained, and had landscaping 


style flower beds surrounding the perimeter of the house.  A few random 


trees littered the front lawn, but appeared no more threatening than a 


Pekinese dog yapping at one's feet. They looked forced and stuck in 


their specific places on the lawn and did not wish to grow past their 


6 foot heights--a rebellion against their planters.


<p>When they came to the door, there was a brightly polished brass 


knocker upon which sat the head of a horse. Tom looked at Molly 


encouraging her to take the responsibility for waking the dead. As she 


gripped the knocker, it felt warm in her hands. She rapt it against the 


aluminum door. It echoed around her as the horse opened its mouth 


and bit her hard on the fingers. She pulled back suddenly, edging 


further and further back until she noticed that there were hundreds 


of eyes staring at her. She could never pinpoint where one of the sets 


of eyes was because it would disappear as she looked straight at the 


place where she saw the piercing gaze. One of the windows seemed 


to be screaming at her "What right?  What right did you have?" 


<p>"What? I just knocked at the door? What are you?  Are you up in that 


room there?" 


<p>"I am that room there and how dare you build this house here?" 


<p>"But I didn't build the house" replied Molly. "The priest lives here." 


<p>"There is no one inside here, and you are on the property what 


right do you have to knock at the door of this house?" 


<p>"I didn't know it was illegal. Will you come out now and show 


yourself?"  


<p>"I can't come out, I am imprisoned in the shape of this room. 


I was imprisoned by a man. Is that him there with you, woman?" 


<p>"Now, does he look like he could really do that?" Molly was feeling 


threatened but more angry than afraid. The house spoke again: 


<p>"The man who imprisoned us left us here for the night it seems. 


He knew we would be waiting for him.  He knew we would take our 


vengeance. I see he took all precautions to keep us in our cells, and it 


seems to have worked. But you woke us, and for that you should be 


punished. We must serve that man all days of the year except this and 


the solstice. You dare to take our peace?" 


<p>"I'm truly sorry, if I could help you I assure you, I would, but 


I really have to go." 


<p>By this time, Molly had made it to the gate at the front of the house 


and she opened it clumsily placing it between herself and the house. She 


saw Tom still staring trying to determine the actual location of the voice. 


<p>"Tom, come on." She said to him hurriedly. Tom slowly began to walk 


toward her on the gravel of the walkway. He turned away from the 


house, and as he did, a rush of air and a flutter surrounded his head like 


a thousand birds flapping their wings at him. He felt heir beaks and their 


claws at him, tearing into him gashing the wounds deeper and deeper and 


simply screamed trying to ward off the creatures. Molly watched as he 


batted at thin air thinking him mad. She reached across the gate, but could 


barely touch him. She grabbed a piece of his shirt, but it tore off, leaving 


her with a blood stained shred. Leaning over the gate as far as she could 


she tried again to reach him, but failed again.


<p>"What do you want from us?"  She screamed into the night.  


Tom stopped fighting, and lay on the ground still switching his eyes 


back and forth afraid of a returning onslaught.


<p>"Would YOU help us?"


<p>"If I can.  Are you related in any way to the Seelies?  They 


seem to know you."


<p>"We were once.  But it has been so long.  We have been 


imprisoned so long.  That is not concern.  Our concern is to escape.  


You must help us, or he will die."  


<p>"I will do whatever I can."


<p>"It's very simply you see. You just open that gate, and leave it 


open, and we will return your friend to you in the morning."


<p>"How can I trust you?


<p>"What choice do you have? I assure you upon my word, that 


he will be returned to you unharmed. Provided you do that one favor 


for us. We simply wish to escape our imprisonment."


<p>"All right."  replied Molly. She had gotten used to the honesty of 


the Seelies, and having trusted them toward the end of their encounter, 


she believed the intentions of these creatures to be the same. After tying 


the gate's door to itself, she walked home alone, glancing back at Tom, 


who was now covered with a green sheet and blanket, asleep and lying 


in a patch of four leaf clovers.  She put her faith in the word of her 


attackers and went home. She said nothing to her family of conservative 


realists. She did not sleep. She dozed a bit at 5 am and woke to the 


sound of shrieking from the center of town. Glendale awoke to this 


sound, and sirens blared in the distance. Molly started up out of bed. 


She was still in her costume form the night before. Putting on a warm 


jacket, she darted out the door to the house where the priest lived next 


to the church and when she arrived she found that the house was gone, 


as was Tom. In his place were crows crowded around a large patch of 


fresh meat that looked as though it had been picked from bones. The 


gate remained around the house, but the entrance was still tied to keep 


it open.  


<p>Behind her she heard the voice from the house. A woman she 


had never seen before was walking with Grimalken.  "Molly, thank 


you. You will be rewarded." 


<p>"I'm not sure I like the reward so far. What was so awful that 


made you kill him?"  Grimalken spoke now "We couldn't tell you 


your fate, only imply it. Ten years ago that priest decided he would 


build his church on our home. When we cam to protest this action, 


he used his Bible and his contrived faerie spells stolen from the books 


of the unseelie and imprisoned us in his own home. We became the 


rooms, the lights, the furniture. Please understand, that this man did 


not mean well. He knew his guilt. He wanted his church so badly, 


however, that he maintained us imprisoned there, and kept all other 


Seelie away, with the Rowan bushes and the four leaf clovers. He 


could always see us for who we were. Our glamours could not help 


us. So we waited, for you.


<p>"You used me."


<p>"Yes. But not as you think. We simply didn't allow you the option 


to question your fate."<p>

<br>Chapter XIII


<br>A Fatal Tea<p>


<br>by David Karge




High up in the west wing of the old castle, Lady Gywneth stood 


defiantly in the baronial window fingering her lavaliere.  The heavens 


showed no mercy that terrible night.  The storm unleashed its rage.  A 


horrific thunder bolt came crashing down outside the window opening 


up the very pits of hell.  Gywneth never flinched.  She rivaled the fury 


of nature herself.  Her wrath knew no bounds.


<p>With a disdainful smile, Lady Gywneth slowly turned around 


and sat down to pour her unsuspecting lover a cup of tea.  She vowed 


Lesley would never leave her again.  EVER!<p>
