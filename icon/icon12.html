Damn, no way to duck out now.<p>She is playing it coy though, making him come up and introduce himself.<p>She is so nonchalant. Well, here goes...<p>"Meeeooooowwww!"<p>Ten minutes later and two blocks away he sat on the lowest limb of theold Sycamore tree in the school yard. Casually he lifted his paw to lickhis fur.

Yeah, everybody and their friggin' family doctor wants to to wake up in a white picketprison in a quiet (i.e. boring) little town.  Who wouldn't want to get chained into their owngenuine American daily routine?  Shit, they last for your entire life!  Now that's the high life, baby! To have your dreams slowly strangled as the years pass (there's a lot to be said for the positivebenefits of a painful and lingering death as you waste away to nothing).  You get to wake up earlyevery morning for 30 or 40 years to go to work for a boss that hates your guts.  You kiss the oldspouse goodbye before leaving the house you'll be paying for for the next three decades.  <i>(Note toWomen:  notice I said "spouse"...all that hard work at getting equal rights has paid off!  Now youget to go join in all the fun that used to only be for men.  The stress and subequent heart attacksyou've all been missing out on can now be yours too!  How glamorous!)</i>.  And don't forget the carwith about 25 more payments on it and a failing engine.  Then you sit behind an itty-bitty desk inan even smaller office during the proverbial nine to five shift.  The boss might even learn yourname someday, Mr. or Mrs. Employee, but only if you are industrious <i>(and more importantly,lucky)</i>.  After all, someone has to keep the country alive and running smoothly.  Wouldn't want our systemof government or economy to seem unappealing, because no one would buy it anymore.  Yes, thetwins of democracy and capitalism skip hand-in-hand merrily over the backs of the happy taxpayers!  That's the American Way, isn't it?  But let's not forget all the happiness on the homefront! Imagine the joy of watching you're 2.35 kids as they grow, the small town ennui draining them ofimagination and creativity.  Yep, eventually they'll all have a bunch of illegitimate kids and becomegas station attendants.  My fellow Suburbians, how great it is to be an American dreamer (becausein our country, the only sure way to see yourself content is while you are asleep or under theinfluence of some drug, legal or otherwise).  Yes, nothing compares to the indescribable bliss ofthe paycheck.  You clutch the piece of paper that magically turns into cash when you go to one ofthose money temples.  How conveinient!  All you have to do is give it to one of those wizardsbehind the glass windows and ALAKAZAM!  You've got a small pile of green that MIGHT feedand clothe and shelter you and yours for another week.  Then it's off to the beautiful doldrumsand dead silence of suburbia.  There is not one sound there to disturb you.  No children playing orneighbors chatting under the setting sun to make one noise.  Just nice, empty streets and lawns</i>(and you thought people only locked themselves in their homes at night during the Dark Ages!)</i>. At times like this <i>(meaning every night)</i> you think about the future!  Ah, the future... a time whenyou can finally die...er...rest and leave your children their inheritance:  all of the debts, impossibleto pay back in one lifetime, that you cherished during your life!  What a wonderful heirloom. There is no better way to say a posthumous "I Love You"!  With that thought you walk into thatpeaceful home.  And everyone will wonder for a while why you rocked your wife and kids andyourself to sleep that night with a shotgun...what, weren't you happy?!<p><hr><br><a href="icon5.html">Volume 2 Issue 3</a> <br>in which it is learned that cloning is not so nice....except for my 20 bretherin<br><a href="index.html">Return to the Menu Page</a> you wimp!</body></html>
