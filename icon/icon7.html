<br>Some delightful insights into the world we call home

<br>Hi ho kiddies.  Welcome to the Simply Rubbish Show.  


I'm your host, Just Some Guy.  Hell with the frivolous 


chatter...let's get down to work.  Apparently there are a lot of 


people having a problem understanding some recent news.  Well, 


allow me to clarify this whole thing for you since that's what I'm 


here for.


<p>TUPAC SHAKUR:  IN THE DUMPSTER


<p>Am I missing something? Tupac was one of the cornerstones 


of this whole gangsta rap thing that's going on right now and that's 


all fine and great.  What does gangsta rap bring to the proverbial 


table of music? Nothing. It's based on shock value. I could sit here 


and type "Fuck this" and Fuck that" and call people obnoxious 


names and maybe I'd get some more people reading me for it, but 


I'm not about that. But if you want to sit and listen to the beats for 


old James Brown songs looped over and over with people 


screaming sexist racist vulgarity that's fine by me. Just turn the 


speakers down when you drive by my house, OK?  But I'm not 


here to talk gangsta rap.


<p>So Tupac gets mowed down the night of the Mike Tyson 


fight (the same night that there is a video of Tupac and some of his 


cronies stomping on some guy I might add). And then some people 


say how great Tupac was and how his music was inspirational. Huh? 


OK, I'll admit that some of his songs were inspirational.  I thought 


"Dear Mama" actually made some interesting points and showed that 


he could present his ideas in an intelligent way.  But: Here we have a 


guy who runs around calling women "bitches" and "hos" and all kinds 


of not-so-nice things.  he hit a fellow rapper with a baseball bat, he 


sodomized a woman at a nightclub, he spat on reporters after one of 


his trials, he allegedly attacked some guy the night of his shooting. Back 


in the 80's there was this big deal being made about people who played 


Dungeons and Dragons and how they thought they could fly and went 


doing headers off buildings and stuff. Tupac did the same thing. He 


brought the world he created through his lyrics into the real world. 


When that line gets crossed is when things start to go wrong. The 


man runs around doing stuff like this and people are surprised he 


ended up dead? It's a simple fact of life that if you act like a piece of 


trash, eventually you are going to end up out by the curb.


<p>Of course I try to make an intelligent argument about his death 


and people begin to toss the R word around: Racist. "You weren't 


saying this stuff when Kurt Cobain died."  You're saying that because 


you don't like rap.  It's everyone's fault that he died because we didn't 


protect him from the streets..." blah blah blah.  Let me clarify one 


thing for everyone out there: Kurt Cobain was not a hero. He was a 


drug addict (who's acne medicine went for 250$ at a raffle might I 


mention?) that got his hands on a shotgun.  If he was a hero he would've 


stayed alive and taken care of his little girl.  I didn't get to vote to make 


him spokesman for my generation.


<p>So here we go again with the whole R word being thrown 


around as soon as someone tries to make a point.  Well I am not going 


to stand for it. Tupac was a racist, sexist, violent criminal. That's right 


kiddies. Crim-in-al.  Trash of society. Garbage. I'm not talking about his 


music here. I'm talking about the person. Just because a person writes 


some lyrics about life that some people may find offensive doesn't give 


them a right to go shooting people. Then comes the other commonly 


heard argument: "Tupac was going to reform when he was in jail, but 


record exec. Suge Knight convinced him to be even more vulgar than 


before." Don't we all have to deal with the temptation of drugs and 


violence and all of that other stuff they tell us about in elementary school? 


Granted that I live in suburban New Jersey and the temptation is a little 


more prominent in places like the inner city, but we don't say stuff like 


that about the 17 year old who kills some guy on the street to support a 


drug habit. Why? Because it's wrong to idolize people like that. Plain 


and simple.


<p>And while I'm on the subject, so many people now are saying how 


ridiculous the East Coast-West Coast Rap feud is. Basically the feud is 


getting to the point where people from the East Coast will be shot if they 


go to the west coast just because of where they are from. Sound stupid? 


Well, people have been doing stuff like that for centuries. Except, we call 


it bias. At least the rap community decided to put an end to this whole 


feud after Tupac got killed, while hundreds have been killed over the 


race-bias issue and it's still going on. So maybe Tupac's death still did 


serve a purpose. But his death does not hide the fact that he was a punk 


in life.


<p>When I told someone Tupac was killed, they had the audacity to 


tell me "God Bless his heart." "God Bless his heart?" Tupac, I will see 


you in hell.
