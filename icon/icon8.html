<br>Conforming to Non-conformity

I have come to realize that I am no more 


an individual than any other silly human.  


There is no way one can be in a society 


where everything is a token feature of some 


group or another.


<p>In high school, I found myself walking 


in the steps of my fore-mothers.  I wore 


my iced pink lipstick and my penny loafers.  


I wore parachute pants a day late and 


found myself a rejected "geek:"  cast 


away from any chance of walking the halls 


as a "cool kid."  After internalizing 


the fact that I wasn't cool, I found that 


I really didn't want to be anymore.  


What the fuck is cool?  Well, at my, 


and any high school, most will remember 


it was the rich middle class pretty/handsome 


white crowd.  Those socially competent, 


fashion gods and goddesses, that dictated 


what was hip and what was the clear sign 


of a social malfient.  


<p>I became part of different elite--the 


"freaks."  There was little I could do to 


fight it, nor did I really try when I found 


myself with a group of people who didn't 


really pay attention to how I looked or the 


clothes I wore or how I expressed myself.  


They just cared what I did express.  As this 


group became a firm influence in my life, 


I began trying hard to show that I was 


a part of it, and sure enough, I was wearing 


mismatched tie-dyed skirts Doc Martens of 


different colours and odd sweaters, dyed 


and shaved my hair and flirted with my 


fate...There was no going back you see.  


But I realized after 15 years of being 


tortured that my chances were very slim 


at ever being a part of that upper 


layer of caterpillars squirming to prove 


they were the royalty of the school.  


I would never be prom queen.  But one 


thing I noticed, was that each individual 


of the group I was part to brought a unique 


contribution to the group.  Something I did 


not see in the "cool kids" from my vantage 


point (perhaps a bit jaded by the jeers 


of the crowds).  The lunch table was in a 


corner of the room and as our cocoon grew 


bigger, the taunting by the kings and queens 


of the may no longer penetrated us.  We, 


essentially, became what we were pushed from. 


<p>Take a step now...4 years later, as 


flannel shirts, Doc martens and dyed hair 


make their way across the "mainstream."  


I see my old crowd washed away in a sea 


of rainbow colours and eyebrow piercings-


the very things we were mocked for--and that 


web of support I had in high school, where 


I could distinguish the people that cared 


for me from the people who didn't has 


vanished.  Alternative?  Hardly. I suppose 


what aggravates me most is that now the 


disgruntled youth is disgruntled about the 


fact that life is not handed to them on 


silver platters--not as it was with me, the 


anger and resentment spurned by cruel 


fellow high schoolers as they pushed me 


into a despair I still resent them for.


<p>Though I realize that the clothes and 


the colours were not the same web of support 


I received from my well ordered group, it is 


still hard to look into that sea of people 


and see the souls of those with no ill will 


towards my quirky behaviour, my love for trout 


fishing in america and big band music.  The 


work of all this is that these trendoid victims 


of the modern DRE culture now look upon my 


worn out Doc martens with reverie and wonder.  


They are an idol of the true alternative chic 


reserved to se few.  All the daily fears 


that high school might set the tone for 


reality confirmed.  We are icons for our 


externals--what a sad lot.  


<p>And as I travel from class to class at 


university, I see the faces of the many trying 


to fulfill a need to belong to some group 


from which they are ostracized.  It 


doesn't exist.  People ostracize each other 


from each other to define themselves, thereby 


perpetuate a cycle of events that leads to 


stupidity.  We push push push away, I have 


too many friends to hang out with you, 


don't need you: fear.  Essentially we are 


ostracizing ourselves not from each other 


per se, but from the fear that shrouds 


our daily lives.  But if that technique 


were working, dysfunction wouldn't be the 


buzz word of the 90's.  We would all be 


healthy people.


<p>But if the circle keeps fueling 


itself from our separation, and as 


our need to shine and set ourselves 


apart or our group apart increases, so 


does our psychological isolation and 


disjointedness increase. 


<p>There is no easy solution I can offer 


to make that pain go away.  I just know 


that I don't worry so much anymore.  How 


nice my car looks, screaming red with its 


battle-scarred hood.  The dust on my floor 


mark it as mine, and the arrayed t-shirts 


of common every day things are how I show my 


group my interests.  My group--the world.<p>

The papal decree of the week</a>


Thou shalt not leave thy annoying cellular 


phones on during class.  Thou shalt realize 


that no telephone call is that important nor 


art thou that important that thou must be 


reached during a lecture by  such gifted 


professors as there are at Rutgers--Camden.  


Unless you are on the kidney transplant list 


waiting for a vital organ, thou hath no need 


for such trivialities.  This decree guilds 


equal for pagers.  That is what the "silent" 


is for.  Thou shalt use it.<p>

<br>"Jehovah's Witness Saved me," that's all they have to say.<p>
