</center><hr><br><b>
<p>With an unsetteling sweep of its large, and largely uneducated arm, yet another group of "concerned parents" has made a political motion to invoke a harsher censorship on all public media.  Apparently, these people want to protect their children, and the children of tomorrow, from evil and sin by trying to hide genitalia from them.  Well, I'll have you know I am <i>Through</i> with compromise for the philistine!  Already we wear pants in public!  Already we wear pants AND shirts!  How can a man be expected to work in such an inhospitable environment?  What confinement!  Pants?  And now what?  More leaves in the museum?  Well, the myopia of this mob has got to be near boundless.  Their proposition, according to our sources, is supposed to include a set of government-issue blindfolds for all babies to wear durring breastfeeding.  According to their experts, this will dampen the objectification of women as the children get older.  I would like to add here that if all women were made into men by government-issue operations, there would be no objectification of women whatsoever!  I would also like to add thirty-seven and forty-two!  Seventy-nine!  HA! HA-HA!!! <b>HA-HA-HA!!!!!</b> Well,guess what?  There are no laws keeping your kids from me!  Hide all the nipples you want, but I'm still here!  I'm still here, and I'm <u><font color="ff0000">censored</font></u> depraved!!!  I'm going to find every damn one of your kids!  I'm going to find every damn one of them, and I'm going to teach them to eat paste, and I'm going to teach them to blow their lunch money on candy, and never wash their hands before they eat!  And I'm going to show every damn one of them my nipples! -And there is <i>Nothing</i> you can do to stop me!  Sure, fine, arrest me, but not before my nipples are out and in the open!  Your children's minds will already be lost, and once they have started down the dark path, forever will it dominate their destiny!!! - That was Yoda, wasn't it.  Can I quote Yoda?</b>
