<p>Johnny Socko is an amazing ska/punk/polka band from Indianapolis, Indiana.  They have been together for six years and have made three albums:  Bovaquarium, Ooh, I Do Hope It's Roast Beef, and Full Trucker Effect.  The latter is music from and inspired by the 70s trucking movie
of the same title, and is extremely good.  The band has a great sense of
humor, as found in such songs as vasectomy.  They are also really
friendly and great guys to talk to if you get a chance.  I highly
recommend seeing them live, as they put on a great show.  From onstage
dress that can range anywhere from a white trash T-shirt (It's not a
Beer Gut - It's a Fuel Tank for a Sex Machine) to dressing in drag, this
band isn't afraid of being too bold or out of hand.  As long they keep
making such classics as "Bitch Stole My Hat," Johnny Socko is a definite
keeper.
