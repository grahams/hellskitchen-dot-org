<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    Can you tell me why there are so many trees, just sitting around in the way of things?  Why didn't God just cut them down and bless us with some sort of natural lumber yard or something?

-The Lord works in mysterious ways, Jenny.<br>

<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    When I was driving, I was going to run a red light because I was in a hurry, but decided to stop when I thought I heard a voice tell me not to run it.  To my suprise, just as I stopped, a car drove across the intersection.  Do I have a gaurdian angel?

-Yes.<br>

<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    The other day, I made myself a salad, but before I could eat it, I noticed what looked like the virgin Mary's face in the lettuce.  Was it really the virgin mary, and if so, was it wrong of me to eat her?

-Jeremy, I am sorry, but I am not qualified to answer that question for you.  My church, however, has an office for such inquiries and would be more than happy to help.  Simply mail them a picture of the possibly holy representation, along with your telephone number and a five dollar processing fee, and they will identify the holy figure beyond any reasonable doubt, as well as tell you whether or not it is sinful to eat them.<br>
