<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Why do some fish swim in schools?
<br><center>-Curious</center><br><br></tt>
-Well, Curious, fish have smaller brains, and are not capable of independant thought.  Many fish have even been known to take part in such mob mentality actions as lynching, rioting and looting, and even poking to death all the little fish that look funny.  All evidence of these actions, however, has been repressed by the trancendentalists.<br>

<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Why do men go bald?
<br><center>-Veronica</center><br><br></tt>
-They don't.  Who the hell told you that?<br>
<center>-Cha-Chee</center><br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    I'm thinking seriously about becoming a scientist of some kind.  Is there anything you can tell me that you think I should know about becoming a scientist?
<br><center>-Hopefull</center><br><br></tt>
-No, actually.  I don't think you should know anything about becoming a scientist.<br>
<center>-Cha-Chee</center><br>

<br>
<tt>Hey, Chachman,<br>
    How do fish's gills work?
<br><center>-Askin</center><br><br></tt>
-First of all, who the hell are you to call me Chachman?  And second, the fish-gill theory has long been outdated.  It has now become evident that just as some animals can run several times faster than a man, a large number of animals can hold their breath many times longer.  Many fish have been known to hold their breath all their lives.<br>

<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    How does my TV set work?
<br><center>-Mellissa</center><br><br></tt>
-Well, I haven't seen your television, but if it is anything like mine, there is a button for turning it on and off near the bottom, as well as four other buttons used to make the volume and channels go up and down.  Play with these four until you are happy with what you are watching.  A more complete understanding will come as you get used to these controls.<br>
