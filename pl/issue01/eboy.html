I suppose you should know a LITTLE about me, which is most likely more than you will ever need. But hey- I feel the need to begin with a beginning. I&iacute;m in college. Southern Methodist University to be exact. School colors are kakhi and FILTHY beat up white(I&iacute;m assuming, here) with baseball caps from various other colleges. The girls frighten me. And who knows what the heck they look like beneath all that makeup. I used to hear all  these stories about how gorgeous college girls are because they wear less makeup and these private college girls are even worse than at my high school. I think there must be something in the water that makes everyone who is capable of giving birth secretly dread the possibility of the CEO of some international organization jumping out of nowhere- while they&iacute;re on their way to breakfast at 7:30- and interviewing them for a job as the most highly paid secretary of all time or something.  Maybe they&iacute;re just too hung over from the night before and don&iacute;t want to show it. Parties are scheduled every single night, which I suppose is not uncommon for most colleges. Guys and girls are constantly bragging about how awesome it was getting trashed the night before. I think they all are trying to prove that they are THAT MUCH cooler for consuming more alcohol than the next person. Obviously it is very hard to get alcohol when you&iacute;re under 21 so these people are quite proud of themselves for getting their hands on some and drinking it in excess. I really do not know how some of these people got into what I thought was a somewhat prestigious school. Here&iacute;s one person of particular genius: I think her name's Christina or Fatbitch or something close to that. She was able to unite quite a few kids in the back row of my religion class against the teacher because they all got C&iacute;s on their essay test. "Well I&iacute;m a Junior and have never had problems on papers before in any of my classes. I read all the assignments, therefore, since I wrote a pathetic essay I deserve an A."  Today she griped about Confucius (Who&iacute;s name is NOT Confucius, it&iacute;s K&iacute;ung Fu Tzu, The Master K&iacute;ung, as he was known. Obviously people can not be influential to world history unless their name has been Westernized.) because he taught men but not women. This particular form of sexism occurred around 495 BC. Clearly my religion professor is part of a plot to suppress this country&iacute;s females and needs to be verbally abused for it. She also protested against the examples the professor gave us of Chinese religion that were present around 1750 BC because they seemed to rely an awful lot on blind faith. What this world needs is more great thinkers like her.
