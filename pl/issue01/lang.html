After seven months of intense research at the American English Language Laboratory in Saint Onory, Michigan, It has been determined beyond any reasonable doubt that both the words "month" and "orange" do not rhyme with anything.  It was discovered that the word "month" was an eye rhyme with the word "splunth" (pronounced "WEE-JEE"), but "splunth" was then found to be a silly word, and was deleted from the dictionary.  The two words "orange" and "month", however, were shipped off to the national seceratary of linguistics, who signed all the necessary papers to make it official that the two words will now rhyme with each other.  This new breakthrough will be sent to poets, lyricists, and kindergarden teachers nationwide, except in Arizona, the only state that does not legaly observe rhyming as a function of a word.
