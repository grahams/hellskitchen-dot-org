<img src="../images/staff/Chachbuh3.JPG" align="left" alt="Hi, I'm Cha-Chee!">This is me.  My name is Cha-Chee, and I am a college boy here at the University of Texas at Austin.  I do the programing and most of the writing for this magazine, and frankly, I love it.  I am sensitive, yet understanding, and I enjoy candle light dinners, long walks on the beach, and cuddling up by the fireplace. -Oh, yes, and the occasional makin' bacon.
<br><br><br>
-E-mail me with comments or suggestions!<br><a href="mailto:Lord_Cha-Chee_The_Indescribably_Wonderful@mail.utexas.edu?subject=I think you are wonderful and I want you to be the father of my children" onMouseOver="window.status='Mail me.  You know you want to.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Lord_Cha-Chee_The_Indescribably_Wonderful@mail.utexas.edu</a><br>That's really my address!  REALLY!

Have you ever been sitting there and wondered to yourself,"Why me?"  Well, I haven't, because I know why, and I'm not going to tell you.  But aside from knowing the meaning of life, there's really not a whole lot to me. As far as wit goes, however, I'm A-list.  I was voted Mr. Wit at last year's "Who's the Wittiest of Them All?" contest, and I took home a beautiful trophy adorned with a large, golden statue of Michael Dukakis.  Now my fish have an algae infested statue to swim around!  Woo-hoo!<br><br>
-Send me stuff.<br><a href="mailto:enorth@mail.utexas.edu?subject=You are the wittiest guy that has ever been." onMouseOver="window.status='Woah... settle down, there Turbo!'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">enorth@mail.utexas.edu</a>

<img src="../images/staff/nickbuh2.JPG" align="left" alt="I'm just Scratching it.">My name isn't really 'Mr. Buh', but I'll be damned if I let you people know my real name.  I'm 6'2" with baby blue eyes, blond hair, a gorgeous face, a terrific tan, and an atheletic build.  Whenever I'm in public, I get pestered by tons of beautiful, tan women who beg me to let them perform all sorts of exotic sexual acts upon me.  Or maybe I look like the picture to the left; you decide.  
<br><br><br>
-Mail me,or don't.  See if I care.<br><a href="mailto:Mr.Buh@mail.utexas.edu?subject=Just writing to tell you I love you" onMouseOver="window.status='I dont want to listen to your crap unless I have to.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=''; return true">Mr.Buh@mail.utexas.edu</a><br>

<img src="../images/staff/ebuh.JPG" align="left" alt="Never boil another human being.  That is wrong.">Hey, I'm E-boy and I'm well known for being untainted by evil, and sharing such things as sidewalk chalk and human kindness.  I am an article of genuine goodness, and I hate, hate, HATE bugs.

<img src="../images/staff/Chichibuh.JPG" align="left" alt="Where's The Beef?">Hi, my name's Chi Chi, and I already know that my name is much like Cha-Chee's(he's my brother).  If you want to talk cool ska music with me, I can dig that, daddio, but if you ask me if I've heard of a new band called the Mighty Mighty Bosstones or Reel Big Fish, prepare to feel the wrath of BARTHOLOMEW!!! HA!HA!HA! (evil laughter)  By the way, my favorite actor is Al Pacino and I possess the power to change my appearance from white trash to pimp to high school student with the snap of a finger and the changing of some clothes.
