<h2><b><u>Cool Word of the Month</u>
<hr>Gastroenteritis
</b></h2>

<hr>
<h3><u>What it means:</u></h3><h4> <i>n. (gas' tro en' te ri' tis)</i>- Inflamation of the stomach and intestines.</h4>
<br><br>
<h3><u>What makes it cool:</h3></u><h4> If you ever sleep through a test or forget to turn in an assignment and you're not sick, go to the University Health Center (or its equivalent in your location) and tell them you have 1 or more of the following symptoms:  fatigue, chills, loss of appitite, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea, low-grade fever.  Then they will tell you that you have gastroenteritis, which is serious enough to excuse a missed test, or a late assignment, but not serious enough for medication or a visit to a real doctor.  Furthermore, gastroenteritis is code in the UT system for, "I missed a test, but I know the secret code to make it up."  It works a lot like the Illuminati or the Freemasons;  all you have to do is know the secret word, and you're in!  So that's why this is the Exhilerating Cool Word of the Month - Gastroenteritis.</h4>
