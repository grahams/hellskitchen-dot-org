<center><h2><b><u>What I Really Want for Christmas</b></h2></u>
</center><hr><br>
Out of everything I could wish for this Christmas, world peace and harmony among men included, the one thing I would like most of all is understanding, with donuts every morning for breakfast, and ravioli every day for lunch and dinner.  I suppose even without the ravioli, just having understanding and donuts would make my life that much more complete.  

<p>But what kind of understanding?  The kind that answers all the questions I ask throughout the day, no matter how odd they are.  Like when I ask why I don&iacute;t get any mail, I want to hear everybody&iacute;s excuses for not writing me, as well as a donut.  When someone bumps into me and doesn&iacute;t even turn around, let alone apologize, and I ask myself "What the hell is wrong with him?" I want to hear that he has a serious mental disorder, or that he is bitter because women just can&iacute;t stand him in general, and I want some of those little chocolate donuts.  And when I wonder why the ice-maker won&iacute;t make ice, when I wonder what is so important that this machine has to stop doing the only thing it is designed to do, I want to hear that a bunch of mongoloids were playing with it and tried to get it to make coffee.  And a jelly donut.  Or a cake donut.  
<p>That is what I mean by understanding, and by donuts, I mean any member of the donut family, which can include cake, cookies, muffins, and pie.
