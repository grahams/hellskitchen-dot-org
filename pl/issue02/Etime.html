It was not long ago at all that I was talking with a dear friend of mine (whose name will go undisclosed for now) about cruel things we could do to people for laughs, when we stumbled upon an idea that sent us both in writhing hysterics;  If we could find some way to go back in time, we could release all the hit songs, which we knew already that people would love because of their catchy tunes, but we&iacute;d release them all with really crappy lyrics!  The public would be forced to like the songs, but at the same time feel both confused and degraded by them, because they had really messed-up lyrics!
<p>
Being a master of the world and its ways, I knew that the quickest path for all natural things to follow is not simply a straight line, but rather the path with the least resistance.  My ultimate goal was to travel back in time and release the hit songs of the seventies and eighties, and I knew that in order to do that, I would have to do some research and experimentation.  The field of time travel was littered with gaps in physical knowledge as well as the fact that I had not a clue as to which of the many theories on time travel to pursue.
<p>
The path of least resistance was obviously for me to research hit songs of the seventies and eighties.  And that is what I did.  I looked at song lyrics, tunes, instrumentation, which songs were instant hits, and who was in these insta-hit bands.
<p>
It was not long, however, before my research brought me to a curious coincidence.  Looking over the lyrics of such songs as "Louie Louie", "My Sherona", and "Beat It", I came to the conclusion that someone had carried out our evil plan before us.  There was no possible way all those songs could have such detestably hilarious lyrics on their own.
<p>
The real suprise came, however, when I went through the old periodicals at the library and looked at pictures of the bands that released these songs. -I noticed a face that was too familiar for me to dismiss, a face that appeared in every picture, a face I saw every day at work;  It was Piggy Lovin&iacute;s own E-Boy!  That Evil son of a mule had somehow done it first!
<p>
Well, both broken and defeated, I made my way home with the scraps of newspapers and magazines I had stolen from the library, and scanned the pictures.  So, here.  See who made a fool out of all of us, because we certainly have been made fools of.
