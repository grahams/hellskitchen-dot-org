<p>This month&iacute;s undiscovered band of the month is New Orleans&iacute; own Galactic.  They are an extremely talented swamp funk band that is quickly on the rise.  I felt the need to do a non-ska band this month in order to establish the fact that there are other bands out there that are very good, just not ska, and that I do listen to other kinds of music.  But enough about that.  Let&iacute;s get back to Galactic.  The New Orleans Gambit describes their sound as "Taking popping snare drums, fat-back bass, muted organ and wah-wah guitars into proven, funky territory (aided by cocky, assured horn parts), Galactic is one-part natural acid jazz and two-parts New Orleans groove."  Started in 1994, this sextet (drums, bass, guitar, organ, trumpet, sax) has played all across the nation, quickly filling up small venues.  They have also won several awards, such as Offbeat Magazine&iacute;s "Best Funk Band of 1997."  Their debut album on Fog City Records is titled Coolin&iacute; Off, and features fourteen tracks of New Orleans soul.  If you are looking for a solid band with great rhythm and music that you can&iacute;t sit still to, these guys are it.
