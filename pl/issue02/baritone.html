<blockquote><blockquote>

<br>I throw my glistening silver euphonium
<br>into the air.
<br>It spins with constant and perfect revelations,
<br>and when it is done, it slips
<br>into my expecting hands,
<br>and I take it by the gentle edges of the bell
<br>and with a great wild swing of my arms,
<br>slam it into the cold hard earth, and
<br>it stands,
<br>Half-burried like a sign post,
<br>and I stomp on it a few times,
<br>and then leave it there.
<br>I am a barritone player.
<br>I am a barritone player.
