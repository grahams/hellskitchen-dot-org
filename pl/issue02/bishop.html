<br>
<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    If we are all children of God, why do I have to call my priest father?  Shouldn't he be my brother?
<br><center>-Patricia</center><br><br></tt>
-"Father" is just a title, like doctor or mister.  It is a very unique title, however, because it can be earned by either taking up the cloth and choosing a life of celibacy, or by getting some woman preggars.<br>

<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    If Adam and Eve were the only people alive at the begining of it all, then wouldn't that make us all te product of incest and inbreeding?
<br><center>-Charles</center><br><br></tt>
-Yes, we are, but you still can't marry your sister, Charles.<br>

<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    I've been thinking a lot about where my life is going, and I think that maybe it is time for me to try to impose my own personal views on as many vulnerable people as possible.  Is it wrong for me to do this?
<br><center>-Timmothy</center><br><br></tt>
-Well, that's a tough question to answer.  If your views are correct, then good job and good luck!  If not, you will rot in hell, and take those poor, gullible souls with you.<br>

<tt>Dear Bishop,<br>
    I have recently broken up with someone who was a girlfriend to me for two years, and I am having problems dealing with most everything in a rational manor.  I just do not know what to do, really.  What should I do?
<br><center>-Gregory</center><br><br></tt>
-Personally, whenever I just do not know what to do, I look through the bible for clues.  If I don't happen to have a copy of the big book of God on me, I usually do things like make a list of words that rhyme, time myself to see how long I can hold my breath, or sometimes I do all those things I keep saying I'll do later, like change those light bulbs that burned out in the kitchen.<br>
