<h4>Ask Cha-Chee anything you like about science, life and the world we live in</h4>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Why do toilets always flush in a counterclockwise dirrection?
<br><center>-Observant</center><br><br></tt>
-Well, there are some people that will tell you it's because of the hemisphere of the world we live in, but there are also some people who will tell you you ask stupid questions.  I am one of the few people who would tell you both.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
Why have we been building space stations, when we have a perfectly good moon out there?  Why don't some people just live on the moon, instead of in some station?
<br><center>-Emily</center><br><br></tt>
-You know what?  If we had a list of great ideas, here at Piggy Lovin', I would have to break out the old sarcasm pen and write that one down.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    What else floats in water?
<br><center>-Toni</center><br><br></tt>
-Hmm, let me think.  You see, this question is an especially hard one because you left out the part where it makes sense.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    How do magicians like David Copperfield make things like planes and statues and stuff disappear out of thin air?  Is it some sort of lighting trick, or what?
<br><center>-Wondering</center><br><br></tt>
-Magic.<br>
<center>-Cha-Chee</center><br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    My little sister just got one of those little dolls that open their eyes when you hold them up, and close them when you put them down.  How do those things work?
<br><center>-Joshua</center><br><br></tt>
-Ooh, man, those things scare the crap out of me.  I imagine they work on some principal of evil, or are run by the devil himself.<br>
