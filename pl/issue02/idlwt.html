</center>
<br>
<hr><h4>
The set of standard ideal weights based on a person&iacute;s height and build (which is controlled by the Official Bureau of Weights and Measures) will be altered and amended as of February eighth.  The men&iacute;s chart for their ideal weights will remain the same, but the chart for women will undergo extreme alterations in both scale and format.  The new chart will read that whatever weight a woman weighs right now <i>is</i> her ideal weight, and that she and everyone else should love her just the way she is.
