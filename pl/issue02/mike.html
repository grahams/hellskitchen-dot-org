<h4>Ask Mike Guarden, an automotive engineer, about your car problems <br>-Questions answered by Cha-Chee</h4>
</center><hr><br>
<br>
<tt>Dear Mike,<br>
    I just got a new car, and it is an automatic.  It runs great anl all, but It has two drive settings, one with a circle around the D.  Which should I use when I drive?
<br><center>-Confused</center><br><br></tt>
-Hell, I don't know.  I imagine they are different in some way or another, though.  My suggestion is to use them both alternately as to not wear one out any more than the other.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Mike,<br>
    My car has been stalling spurratically at stoplights and inclines.  What should I do?
<br><center>-Jerome</center><br><br></tt>
-Take it to the shop, man.  There's something wrong with it.<br>
<center>-Cha-Chee</center><br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Mike,<br>
    My car has been making a "Clunk Ratta-Ratta Chunk-Flop" noise lately.  Do you know what that noise is?
<br><center>-Jessica</center><br><br></tt>
-No, is it from a movie or something?<br>
<center>-Cha-Chee</center><br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Mike,<br>
    My car starts when it wants to, stalls when it wants to, and even flashes that "fuel low" light and my hazard lights at random times.  It's like it has a mind of it's own.  Do you know what the problem is?
<br><center>-Don</center><br><br></tt>
-Hey!  Did you ever see those old "Herby the Love Bug" movies?  Those were so funny!  They were all about this little Volkswagon bug that was alive and raced other cars and did cute little car things.  Boy, that was some funny stuff.<br>
