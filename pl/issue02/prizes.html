-The winner of this month's contest could recieve one of many prizes, including a free subscription to Piggy Lovin', a pair of briefs both worn and autographed by every member of the Piggy Lovin' staff, a box (available in either cardboard or oragami styles), or a heapin' helpin' of nothin'.  The first place winner will get to choose their prize, the honorable mention(s) will have their prize(s) chosen for them, and the dishonerable mention will probably have their right to free speech revoked.
