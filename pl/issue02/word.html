<h2><b><u>Cool Word of the Month</u></h2>
<hr><h1>- Monkey Nut -
</b></h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h3><u>What it means:</u></h3><h4> <i>n. (mung' kee nut)</i>- A Peanut.</h4>
<br><br>

<h3><u>Example:</h3></u><h4>The phrase "Monkey nut butter"</h4>
<br><br>

<h3><u>What makes it cool:</h3></u><h4>Not only does this cool new word contain the word "Monkey," but also the word "nut," making it cooler than both of those words combined, or actually, exactly as cool as both of them combined.  The day I found this word, I swore never to use the word peanut again, except out of necessity, and since then have been the life of many parties for my unorthodox way of referring to peanuts.</h4>
