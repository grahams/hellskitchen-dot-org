<p>
The Pilfers are a new, five-piece, all-star ska band.  Coolie Ranx,
formerly of the Toasters, delivers energetic vocals for the group.  He
is supported by Vinny Nobile (formerly of Bim Skala Bim) on trombone,
Anna Milat-Meyer on bass, Nick Bacon (from the Drivers), and James
Blanck (from Skinnerbox).  Hailing from all over the Northeast, these
guys have brought forth a very unique mix of traditional and third-wave
sounds that is truly all their own.  They currently have one self-titled
album out, one that I particularly recommend.  Currently playing across
the northeast with the likes of the Pietasters, Scofflaws, and Bim Skala
Bim, don't miss the opportunity to see them if they come to your town.
