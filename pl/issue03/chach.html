<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Is is possible for people to naturally smell like fish, or should I worry?
<br><center>-Jeremy</center><br><br></tt>
-Whether or not it is natural, Jeremy, <i>you smell like fish</i>.  Do something about it.  Nobody likes to smell fish, and I am no logician, but I think I can still conclude here that nobody likes to smell you.
Fix it.

<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
What did people do before fire extinguishers?  Was there something similar we used back then, or did people just burn a lot more?
<br><center>-Anna</center><br><br></tt>
<br>-In general, people just burned alot more, but members of the upper class have been receiving asbestos shots as a sort of "vaccination" for ages.  That is why they are harder to set on fire.

<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    What is a woodchuck, really?
<br><center>-Anonymous</center><br><br></tt>
-Due to your anonymity, I assume you must be aware of the sensitive nature of this question, and why I cannot answer it here.  Get a hold of me in person, and we can talk.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Why do we have lots of little teeth, instead of one big food mashing thing?
<br><center>-Rebecca</center><br><br></tt>
-Think about it Rebecca.  You can't make braces for something like that.  If your mashy-thing is crooked, you're just screwed.<br>

<br>
<tt>Dear Cha-Chee,<br>
    Do all animals smell funny, or just the ones people take care of?
<br><center>-Thomas</center><br><br></tt>
-Thomas, I do not have a response for your question, but I decided to post your inquiry anyway so I could show it to my friends and let everybody see just how dumb you are. Ha ha ha.<br>
