<p>O.K., maybe you thought it was weird that I have not been complaining too much about last issue's
crappy band of the month
(considering I do complain about crappy bands a lot).  Well, rest assured, I
complain a lot about this month's crappy band (some would say too much).
<br><br>

This month's band is:<br>
<center><h3> - Tilting Wilma - </h3></center>

<br><br>

These guys barely deserve to call themselves a band.  It sounds more
like eight guys playing loud and incoherently, and, oh yes, they
occasionally play together.  These idiots are under the impression that
just because they have a horn section, they're ska.  In that case, the
Squirrel Nut Zippers are ska.  Oh, wait, they're not!  They're swing!
What was I thinking!  Probably that not only do these guys suck, they're
obnoxious trouble makers, too.  Recently, they were invited to play a
show at the same place my friend's band was playing, Tilting Wilma being
the opening act.  They took it upon themselves to invite a punk band
that they knew to close the show, even though it wasn't cleared with the
guys putting on the show, nor was the place available long enough for
another band.  Needless to say, this created a problem, and the punk
band was not happy when they found out they weren't going to play (they
did seem to think they could fix it by cussing out just about everyone
in the place).  Coincidently, Tilting Wilma didn't stay long enough to
take any blame.  They just stayed long enough to mosh to two songs from the good
band that they were opening for, which pissed everyone off, because they
were not a moshin' kind of band.  Needless to say, I take no mercy when I see
them, especially when they are stupid enough to wear one of their crappy band shirts.
