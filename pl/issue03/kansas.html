<h2><b><u>An Essay on the Existance of Kansas</u></b></h2>

<hr><h3></b>
The United stated of America. Fifty individual units united together by the incredible
     binding power of our unscrupulous national government. But in this day and age, you
     can&iacute;t even trust the number of stars on our own flag. That&iacute;s right, gullible America, we
     have a nation of only 49 states. Thanks to the pretty easy number fifty, our country
     decided to round our count of states up to the nearest ten. Kansas was devised, created,
     and added to the union during the Carter administration, under the orders of executive
     kingpin Jimmy Carter himself. Kansas does not really exist. I mean, have you ever met
     anyone from Kansas? No. Of course not. No one has. The only people from Kansas are
     government agents hired to spy on and deceive the public. So if anyone ever tells you
     they&iacute;re from Kansas, they&iacute;re either a government official, or a lying son of a mule. 
<p> But
     Jimmy was smart. Oh, he was a wily one. He went back and stuck Kansas in the history
     books right before the Civil War, when nobody would either notice or care, and then he
     even went on to give them a baseball team, a state bird and flower, and congressmen in
     Washington. That is how the most evil senators stay in senate. They go to the house
     through Kansas, and since there is no population to vote them out, they can keep their
     evil congressional work going without pause. 
<p>Ooh, Jimmy was a diabolical man. And a
     smart man. Smart enough to change most every map in the United States, but not smart
     enough to dupe me, because I found out all about his little
     adjustment. You know the Kansas City Royals? They play out of Missouri. Have you
     ever tried to drive to Kansas? Nobody ever has, and all the policemen you ask for
     directions ask you why you&iacute;d want to go there, and they just look at you funny when
     you say you&iacute;re visiting relatives or friends. They don&iacute;t like you looking for what they
     know isn&iacute;t there. And if you look up the word Kansas in a Summerian-English
     dictionary, you&iacute;ll see that "Kansan," roughly translated, means "a big prank or joke on
     the American public." 
<p>Well, Mr. Carter you have one sick sense of humor, and America
     isn&iacute;t laughing. America is smart. And America wants to hear
     the truth. And I&iacute;m smart. And I want to tell America the truth. So next time you plan
     on messing with the American public, I suggest you plan again, because the American
     people won&iacute;t have it. If anyone wishes to purchase actual maps of the United States
     without the Kansas alterations, they can be ordered through me for twenty-five dollars.
