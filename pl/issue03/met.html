As you have probably noticed, there has been a lot of bad weather
lately, and it's got me thinking.  Parts of California have been
receiving more rain than they have in over a hundred years, and
tornadoes are devastating Florida.  The people turn to the
meteorologists and say, "Hey!  What's with with all this weather?"  The
weatherman answers with a smug look on his face, "Why, it's 'El Nino!'"
Like idiots we say to ourselves, "Of course!  Why didn't I think of that
before!"  But frankly, I'm not buying it anymore.  About a year ago,
when I was skiing in Canada, they were in the middle of an unusually
warm winter.  When I looked in the newspaper, they were ready to offer
an explanation.  "It's El Nino!"  They then went on to explain what this
buzz word meant, which was very interesting.  I mean, I was fascinated
how a patch of water in the Pacific Ocean could effect the weather in
Canada.  But as time grew on, and as bad weather struck across America,
El Nino seemed to be there to take responsibility for it all.  I became
suspicious.  
<p>First of all, look at the name: El Nino.  They gave it a
spanish name, hoping that us ignorant Americans wouldn't realize that
they named this weather phenomenon "The Boy."  Come on, they use real
names for hurricanes, and those things come and go in a matter of days.
They could of at least had the decency to name this thing Roberto.
Who's heard of Hurricane Kid?  Secondly, don't you find it just a little
too convenient that we can't see El Nino for ourselves?  We have to look
at the weatherman's equipment to see some satellite enhanced thermal
imaging photographs to see what we presume is the El Nino they're always
talking about.  I know what you're thinking: "What are they going to do
with El Nino?"  Wipe out the entire continent and create of nation of
meteorologists, that's what they're going to do.  It's fairly simple
how, too.  Let's take the tornadoes in Florida.  I mean, I've seen the
videos of miniature tornadoes that people have created in science
classes, but those videos are always outdated.  So, who's to say that
they can't make the real thing by now?  On the other coast, there's
excessive rain and mudslides.  Come on, they're just over using
drought-ending techniques.  And we don't suspect this weather as foul
play, just an act of God.  But they're actually the acts of weathermen.
Evil weathermen.  And let me tell you, when that first earthquake
strikes, I'm kicking some meteorologist ass.
