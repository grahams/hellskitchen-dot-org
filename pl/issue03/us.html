<img src="../images/staff/Chachbuh3.JPG" align="left" alt="Go ahead, smell the screen!">This is me.  My name is Cha-Chee, and I am a college boy here at the University of Texas at Austin.  I do the programing and most of the writing for this magazine, and frankly, I love it.  I am sensitive, yet understanding, and I enjoy candle light dinners, long walks on the beach, and cuddling up by the fireplace. -Oh, yes, and the occasional makin' bacon.

<img src="../images/staff/ebuh.JPG" align="left" alt="Never boil another human being.  That is wrong.">Hey, I'm E-boy and I'm well known for my success in the Texas State "Mr. Tangerine" competition, and I have been told several times that I smell like taffy.  I have also been told many times that I do not smell like taffy, so decide for yourself.  I am a lover of fine things, a finder of lovely things, and I hate, hate, HATE bugs.

Well, due to the response I got, I figured that one person read my bio

your turtle?  Uh-huh. . .sorry, I can't get a copy of Galactic up here.

<img src="../images/staff/nickbuh2.JPG" align="left" alt="I'm just Scratching it.">My name isn't really 'Mr. Buh', but I'll be damned if I let you people know my real name.  I'm 6'2" with baby blue eyes, blond hair, a gorgeous face, a terrific tan, and an atheletic build.  Whenever I'm in public, I get pestered by tons of beautiful, tan women who beg me to let them perform all sorts of exotic sexual acts upon me.  Or maybe I look like the picture to the left; you decide.

Narcissist- look it up and you'll see my freakin' picture. Now listen up primates,
I love myself. In fact I love myself much MUCH more than you and your fat
stupid friends.  Do you want to know why?  Because I am much better than
you. You are INFERIOR compared to me.
What? You don't speak English? Well press numero dos.  My camera equipment is
more costly that your soul and certainly is a hell of alot more important.
