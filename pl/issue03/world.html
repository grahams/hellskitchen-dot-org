</center><hr><br>

Twenty years from right now, the world will be a place so different from the current
     norm that the very thought of what is now our present existence will seem fabricated
     and mythical. There will be new comforts and technologies, new trends and tastes, and a
     completely new world power - ME.
<p>I&iacute;m sorry, I believe I was a little vague when I said
     that I would be a world power. What I meant by that was that I would be <i>THE</i> world
     power. I will stand unrivaled and unquestioned as the head of the Globose
     Commonwealth of Humans, and whatever I deem law is law - whatever I deem illegal or
     punishable is corrected. Of course, such utter domination does not come easily. I have a
     complex plan, beginning with my graduation from high school, that will faultlessly lead
     me to supreme world power.
<p>You see, I&iacute;ve already begun preparing for my life of
     conquest and rule. Of course I&iacute;ve been spending a lot of time bossing people around so
     I&iacute;ll be ready when I get to the top, but I&iacute;ve also been preparing for my rise to power.
     For two years now, I&iacute;ve been working long hours at countless joe jobs, and stuffing
     every penny I&iacute;ve earned in the bank. I have already been accepted to a tiny college in
     Michigan with a full four year scholarship, and have informed my parents that I will be
     attending that college, needing only meal and spending money from them - which is to
     be sent in cash Upon my arrival at college, I will take up a part time job near my dorm
     room, and as for the classes I will be signed up to take from my college, I will skip every
     one.
<p>Once this routine is established, I will have my name legally changed to John
     Carrousi, which also happens to be the name of a well established SCUBA diver and
     marine expeditionist. My next move will be to contact every corporation and
     multimillionaire in middle America under my new diver persona, and pitch to them an
     expedition to find a sunken ship lost while transporting loads of gold. The only problem
     will be that this expedition will require some funding, and I, although well qualified as a
     marine expeditionist, have not the means to fund it. After promising more than a full
     return to every get-rich-quick schemer who hands over a check, I will buy loads of guns
     and hire as many members of the local militia groups as possible.
<p>About the same time
     my failing semester grades reach my parents, I will take my little army overseas and
     land them in Zaire, the relatively inactive and seldomly noticed African third world
     country plagued with horrible debt and inflation. There we will march right into
     Kinshasa, Zaire&iacute;s capital, and take the country over. Without the means to ward off any
     set of well armed men, they will have no choice but to comply. I will then give every
     citizen a choice. They will have the option of being a soldier in my army and fed two
     meals a day, or they can be put to work on the land raising crops to feed my army. I
     will then have every tree that stands in Zaire&iacute;s woodlands torn down and sent overseas
     to be sold as cheap lumber. Much of the millions in profit the lumber sales will bring me
     will then be put to use mining the rich supplies of copper, diamonds, and oil, which will
     be sold overseas as well. These resources will be strip mined very easily without the
     intrusion of those annoying trees or animals. With enough profits from the slashing and
     stripping of Zaire, I will be able to hire even more mercenaries and buy even more guns,
     and soon I will have an army capable of crushing any force in southern Africa.
<p>I will then march into nearby Congo, and impose the same strip-for-money policy there, and
     one by one, every African country will fall under my control, followed by the middle
     east, then Asia and the pacific islands. With my army in the billions, and my wealth in
     the trillions, after I have taken over Europe, North and South America will pose little
     threat.
<p>The Americas defeated, I will just claim Australia as my own, and there will be
     no dispute. I will then become the ruler of the human race, which I will collectively call,
     for aesthetic reasons, the Globose Commonwealth of Humans. Once I have received my
     supreme and absolute power I will set rules and laws for the people and laugh at them
     for being little lambs that were so easy to take over, and I will enjoy my power restfully.
     You see, there is nothing anybody can do to stop me, and nothing anybody can do to
     avoid me. I will rule you. I will own you. I will tell you when to eat, when to sleep, and
     when to breath, and if I decide that I don&iacute;t want you to breath, you&iacute;ll just have to go
     without air. I&iacute;ve given you warning. Watch out.
