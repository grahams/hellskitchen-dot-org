<DD>Predator.  Say it aloud for yourself once.  The word is a powerful one, and it rolls off the tongue like a ball of pins and needles. 
aTo enunciate it, you must spit out each syllable with a staccato flick of the tongue.  The word predator never killed anyone; yet it 
evokes a feeling of danger.  A feeling of danger reminiscent of the shudder that comes when you realize that the cute little white 
bunny rabbit on the television is about to die in the jaws of the lynx as it whipped around at high speeds by its neck.  It’s like the 
flutter in the stomach when you realize for the first time that the bull in the ring with the matador is going to bleed itself into numbness 
from its collection of painfully shallow flesh wounds long before it is mercifully butchered.  The feeling of danger stems from our ability 
to empathize; we feel a kind of pity for things that we watch die.  We are excited by the idea that the predators out there (lions and 
tigers and bears, oh my!) might come to kill us for dinner.  Or so we tell ourselves.  Actually this applies only to the squeamish 
among us.  Those who believe death is wrong and should be avoided at all costs.<BR>
<DD>In truth we grant ourselves a small thrill of bloodlust every time we watch one of those little white snowshoe rabbits get torn to 
pieces by the toothy ferocious bobcat, and every time the alligator’s jaws clamp down on the leg of its kill ( with the braying whimpers 
of the prey just before it is dragged below the surface and drowned), and even the matador with his army of spear-armed clowns.  
Especially that last.  We are allowed to grant ourselves a much larger thrill of bloodlust when we see a human being (one of us!) 
killing its prey.  The game of cat and <BR>

<TR><TD>mouse is expanded to bruising proportions.  We play games with our prey without even knowing what we are doing.  <BR>
<DD>Predators are powerful:  they are the top of the food chain, they are aloof, and they are deadly.  There is no such thing as a predator who does not kill because it must kill to eat and it must eat to live.  So it is locked into a pattern of death to sustain its own life. Ironic and yet very tasty. <BR>

<FONT size=4>Vacuum Blues</FONT> - <EM>The ravings of an isolated man.</EM> 
<P>
<PRE>The other day I (actually it was over two weeks ago and 
at night, but I can’t take the pressure any more.  I 
remember vividly the first time I realized I was not alone.  
It’s true that I can not see or hear any other living things 
around me, but every time I re-enter the room, I notice 
things.  I notice the subtle changes that have been made 
in the details of my sanctuary since I left it.  I am <EM>not</EM> 
alone. I was under the deliberate impression of seclusion.  
Imagine, if you can, my horror at the accidental discovery 
of my accompanying demons.  Picture clearly as a lead 
bell the dismay that slid through my consciousness when I 
realized the implications of this tragic, yet unequivocal 
fact.  <EM>I</EM> am <EM>not</EM> alone. And this is why, after all this time 
and after all the determined effort, I must spring this 
blistering trap of finality.  To end the pain and to free my 
self into the isolation of bliss for eternity.   This must be 
the way.  This is the way it must be.)  went for a walk and 
realized I was not alone.  </PRE><BR>
