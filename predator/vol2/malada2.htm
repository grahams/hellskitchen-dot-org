<DD>Lately I'm felt this malaise coming over me.  I've decided to go on a quest.  A little journey to find dewey, the only person who had half a clue as to what the hell is going on.  But what happened to him/them?  Where is/are he/they?  I've taken it upon myself to find out.  I asked around but everybodyI talked to had a different story of how they died.  None of them have seen or heard of dewey.  Not knowing what to do, I did like any other human faced with a dilemma: decided to take a nap.  So that's what I did.  Plunked my ass down underneath the nearest tree and promptly fell asleep.</DD><BR>
<DD>I was sleeping under a tree, thats normal enough.  However, when I awoke, I found I was covered in a green wash of light.  Everything around me was flavored in in hues of green.  It seemed the color was wafting from over a hill.  Ever curious , I proceeded to climb the hill.  Wasn't even really a hill.  It was more like a pimple on the Jolly Green Giant.  I mean really, what did I have to fear.  I was already dead.</DD><BR>
<DD>I crested the Pimple and saw one of the strangest things I've ever seen in this world or the last.  I could only assume they were natives of this place.  They were these six legged creatures and they were prancing around a pit, chanting.  Quick as I could I dropped to the ground and slid back just behind the crest so they wouldn't see me.</DD><BR>
<DD>The dancing became more and more frenzied and they started clicking their chitinous wing covers together in the most amazing rhythms.  I was enthralled.  I must have sat there for hours watching them, I couldn't move.  I don't know what happened but one of them must have seen me because the next thing I knew the circle broke and they stormed the Pimple  It felt like the opposite of Custer's last stand.  I sprung to my feet and ran pell-mell back down the side of the Pimple.   Something flashed in my peripheral vision.  I risked a glance back and, holy shit, they're throwing arms at me.  They are ripping their own arms off and throwing them at [THUNK].</DD><BR>
<DD>I stirred back into consciousness while they were carrying me back down the Pimple toward the hole.   For half a second I thought they were going to just set me down.  Nope, I was wrong.  They tossed me down the  abyss.  I felt a little like Alice, falling down the rabbit hole.  It didn't even feel like I was falling.  It was nice.  I was actually enjoying it, sort  of.  Just for the hell of it i took some stuff out of my pockets and let it go just to see what happened. I was pushing it around, knocking it into walls and such.  Playing really, but then I hit the spikes.  Fuck.  </DD><BR>
<DD>I died. </DD>
<DD>Again. </DD>
