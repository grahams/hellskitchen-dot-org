<P><DD>I think that it is a picture of the future, when we invent those cool platform-things like 
they have in Mega-Man 3, where you hit the fire button and this big platform shows up, so you 
can jump on it, but then it goes away, except in the picture the platforms are permanent and 
the first one was built so that they could build the second one, and the second one was built 
so that they could build the third one, and they levitate. </DD><BR>
<DD>And the thing on the the left is the Loch Ness Monster, which has arisen to eat the people 
on the top of the third platform.  Except he can't because they have restrained him, and the 
the people on top of the platform are there to look at the Loch Ness monster.</DD><BR>
<DD>And the thing on the right is the edge of the above-ground pool that they keep the 
Loch-Ness monster in, because they captured the monster and put it in the pool. </DD><BR>
<DD>And it's in the mid afternoon, so that thing in the upper right is the sun.  And of the 
people on the top platform, the second one from the left and the third one from the right 
have long hair, and it's blowing in the wind.</DD><BR>
<DD>Or maybe if you rotate it 90 degrees clockwise it's someone with three eyes and a 
round earring.</DD><BR>

    <STRONG>The Light Dead Elephant Shoe</STRONG>

Advocating the anvil-hating,
Just as I am waiting, 
for jealousy to sore,
a thought unrelated
and born, 
Relentlessly stated,
and scorned,
a feeling of hopelessness, 
That reeling of heartlessness and palsy anticipation--
...waiting for

a mistress wrapped in a burgundy dress,
A bright red I-love-you, radiating sweet breath, 

--Oh but
Beautiful fields, 
	  Once shone upon the rusty shields,
		of fearless Knights who chipped at bones and,
					 avenged for feeling,
						 for freedom,
					       from darkness,
						  to healing.

    The Word of the Day, used in a sentence: <BR>
    The major function of the playground is to entertain, but the emotional states of the children are a gallimaufry of see-saw glee, clumsy embarrassment, momentary elusive utopia, and stinging running scrapes.

The other Knight may have been a lot like me,
Or perhaps,
his fate was more solemnly free-for so many Knights,
			      --for so many 		    nights I have been searching to,
							sizzle the tears of rejection fears,
					searching to find the one-on-one togetherness gears.

When will I find my mistress,
My bright red I-love-you?
Then will I loose my useless,
Light Dead Elephant-Shoe.
