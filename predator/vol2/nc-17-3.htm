I was sitting under a fetus tree (where babies grow (did you really think TheyTM let you 
fuck in hell?)) and I was talking to this person that had an interesting story.  It was 
about how he came to be here.<BR><PRE>
"There was silence.
..............
[riiiiiiiiip]
..............
I slowly swam into consciousness
[riiiiiiiip]
(AARRRHHHHHGGGGG!!!!)
(WHAT THE FUCK?)
[RIIIIIIIIP]
A satisfied sound
"mhmphmhmphmh"
"mmm, I see you are awake now."
HMMMRFRUMMM
"would you like the gag removed?"
"Murf"
He reached over and pulled the object from my mouth. I 
didn't even get to see what it was, and I really didn't give 
a fuck because the pain was tearing up and down my spine..
"Who are you and what the fuck are you doing to me?!?!"
"I am the Flenser. I have been called here to clean. You."
His blades flickered in the dome light overhead and threw 
reflections on the walls.  A noise, metal striking metal, 
and then... 
[RIIIIIIIIP]
The flesh was torn from the small of my back all the way 
up to my neck.
"FUUUUUAAAAAAAAAHHHHHKKK!  Untie me NOW!"
"I cannot and shall not.  You are not clean."
[riiiiiiiiiiiiiip]
Thrashing..
"LET. ME. GO."
[riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip]
My head arched back and then I saw in the mirror on the 
wall the dog with the blades and I realized... 
[RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP] 
The next thing I remember I was underneath this tree."</PRE>
<DD>I'm not sure if I believe him.  I heard he did heavy drugs on the other side, but then again, dewey did say "we get all kinds here." </DD><BR>
<DD>Come to think of it, this guy never moves from under that tree...</DD><BR>

<PRE>
and there were more worms 
seeping out of the ground that night 
than I've ever seen in my life...
forced from study (another preparatory
bout, me versus a cat with academic teeth)
by a klaxon's knell
	cooking gone wrong or the dread 
	Cannabis, ring the alarm, and I'm
out into the smell of worms bellying
	to their deaths, and rain soaks,
	a winter-death baptism benediction.	
On the sidewalk
	They gather in pools of sulfur light 
cast by energy savr bulbs
inch to nightcrawlers, 
	still writhing or knobby tire smeared,
and everywhere I walk kills.
	(a rubber sole more merciful
		than drowning)
profane,there spineless reek
	eyeless, mindless, dirt-eating weak      
cutting yields nothing, not two.
	I wish for fishbarbs to skewer 
you each,so may cheat the sun its joy of
		baking you.
	better still a host of eager yet
clumsy third-grade biologists to make of 
you a gory first dissection.
	tonight nothing helmenthic earns audience,
		and tears of dying worms 
			mingle with the rain.
