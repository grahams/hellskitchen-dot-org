<FONT size=+2>We are vindicated!</FONT> 
Either that or the power of suggestion has been running 
rampant.  We ran an article on the flopsy-mopsy quality of technology of RIt, 
and just a couple of hours later, one of RIt's favorite computers 
spontaneously combusted, sending into oblivion over eighty percent of the 
data stored on it.  Heheheh.  Can't win, can they?  Or, can we, I should 
say, since we lost all of our data stored there as well, including the 
beginnings of the Predator website, so if you were getting impatient, 
you'll have to wait even longer now, thanks to this minor catastrophe. 
OR, alternatively, you could volunteer to help take on the work of 
assembling the website by contacting BJ Leopold at &lt;BJL4009@rit.edu&gt; 
and saying “I wanna help with the Melancholy Predator's Website, when can 
I start?”</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TD valign=top><IMG src="img/notesund.gif" border=0 alt="[Notes from The Underground]"><BR>
Hey there kids.  'Member me?  I was the kid that died in the name of love a while back (specifically, Predator Vol.1, Iss.8).  Let me fill you in on what's been goin' on since then...<BR>
I died. <BR>
There was nothing.  I started to get scared.  “god, what if the atheists were right”  but then...<BR>
light. <BR>
more light. <BR>
I thought to myself, wow, it's just like the X-files.  Then, there was this sound, almost … melodious.  It was like some kind of fucked up Disney tune.  The light kept getting closer and closer, and the whistling kept getting louder and louder.  Finally, the light's right up in my face.  Its these four little guys, the one in front was holding a maglite (everybody's got one except me).  They looked like the four horsemen of munchkin land.  and then the little guy said “iu jorp gluft otle nkoben fort labile"<BR>
“WHAT?!?”<BR>
“Oh, you speak english, we get all kinds here.  Come with us.”<BR>
“Where are you taking me?” I asked<BR>
“To the other side, of course” <BR>
<DD>So we trudged off into the dark while they started whistling again.  It seemed like we went on for days .  I didn't get hungry, thirsty or even tired.  It seemed that all bodily functions were repressed.  I was curious who my escorts were.  I asked the one with the flashlight, “What's your name?”</DD><BR>
He said, ”Well, I'm dewey.  Actually we all are.”<BR>
“That's strange, why?”<BR>
“We don't know. we just nod and smile, Its one of the Great Decrees”<BR>
<DD>That left me silent for a moment.  I walked on, staring at my shoes.  After a while it seemed to be getting lighter.  I looked up and saw a glowing pole that ran vertically into infinity; bifurcating my view. </DD><BR>
Dewey said “Get on”.<BR>
I didn't question.  I reached up and wrapped myself around the pole and it in turn wrapped itself around me.  Both ends folded around and enveloped me in something akin to a giant glowing doughnut.  Then everything started to get hazy...I guess I blacked out because when I woke I was floating on my doughnut in this sea of...milk.  I don't know how long I was out but the currents were swift.  I reached land before too long.  And, I guess that's how I got here.  I'll write more later.  I've got tons of things to tell you but the floggings start in five minutes and they give you extra if you get there early. <BR>
<P>
until next time
