<FONT size=+2>Abstract Melancholy Challenge</FONT>
<P>This is the first response to our challenge.  We at the Predator are discovering firsthand what the editors of GDT have been complaining about for almost a year now:  Our readership is horribly lazy.  We feel like a PBS phone-a-thon standing up and asking for feedback (it's nice to know somebody's listening, somebody gives a shit what we print, etc.) knowing full well that only a small percentage of those who watch will actually call in and say, “yeah, your shows are cool” or even “you guys suck the big chicken” and only a small percentage of those will actually submit anything.  So,on that note, our accolades go out in earnest to this week's Melancholy Challenger... fire away!

<DD>This abstract picture has several interlinking images and meanings, all 
pointing to the absurd cacophony of stale concepts and illegitimate constructs 
popularly known as "Christianity".</DD><BR>
<DD>We shall start at the line at the extreme left of the picture, with the long, double-curved 
vertical line.  This line is clearly an outline of the right-hand side of Jesus' head, including 
the long hair.  Combined with the Hewbrew-looking script to the left of it, it sends a clear 
message about Christianity:  it's a load of some of the most refined, putrified, airtight case 
of BS that one could ever hope for.  Most "devout" Bible-thumping, knocking-on-my-door 
Christians have forgotten that Jesus was a JEW.   They also forget the real teachings of Big 
Daddy J (as he was never called) and choose to supplant and embellish them with their own agenda, 
which includes, but is not limited to: eating fish on Fridays, head coverings for all females 
during Mass, and large, ornate buildings which you only go into once a week for an hour. 
Also, for further emphasis of his, the hidden image of Jesus appears to be raising his middle 
finger, as indicated by the figure in the lower right hand side of the picture. </DD><BR>
<DD>There is, however, another level to this line, previously identified as the outline of Jesus' 
head.  It also is strikingly similar to an integral sign.  Combined with the nonsensical hash on 
the right side of it, it clearly indicates a correlation between the feelings of a frustrated 
Calculus II student, and the frustration of those who see the dominant religions of the country 
as nothing but a sham, albeit an inescapable one.  To further emphasize that Christianity is a 
load of BS, we can see this abstract picture as an equation, with Jesus on the left side, and 
the imaginary number i on the right.  On a fundamental level,  this is saying that Christianity 
is not based in reality, but is, in fact, totally imaginary and likely to remain 
that way forever.</DD><BR>
<DD>My compliments to the artist for making such a powerful statement with such few elements.  Congratulations! </DD><BR>
