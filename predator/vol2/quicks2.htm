<DD>This&nbsp;technological&nbsp;abyss has engulfed neighboring College of Science as well. 
The facilities there, which should be the very center of efficient technology, are 
defunct chambers of outdated, bedraggled laboratory equipment. The local microorganisms 
vacation at the invigorating Autoclave Spa. The NMR machine refuses to resonate and 
the pH meter has electrodes that have been seized by the plague. The machines seem 
to have adopted minds of their own. The pinnacle of technological insanity, however, 
is the infamous RIT ID card. Those times when you are tired and hungry, but your meal 
card refuses to register in the machine and that old woman swiping it is beginning to 
mutter not-so-sweet nothings under her breath. Or when you go to the gym to work out 
and you wait behind a few a people, who's cards all seem to work fine.  
But when it is finally your turn, the machine </DD></TD>

	maliciously rejects your card and as you frantically try again only to turn 
	around and see a swarm of people hovering over you because they do not 
	understand that its not your fault until it happens to them when they get 
	their chance at the evil swipe machine.<BR>
	<DD>And yet, we are all somehow convinced that we could not live without all 
	this glorious technology.  It's amusing (and sometimes amazing) how quickly 
	we forget that human beings managed thousands of years without it back in the 
	"good old days" of foraging for food.  The established crutch of technology 
	allows us to take one step "higher" than we were, but at the expense of our 
	own natural muscles, which have atrophied in the meantime: most humans no 
	longer know how to survive in the world without technology. </DD><BR></TD>

<PRE>Squirrels are fiercely territorial and
much less friendly than rats. Methinks
squirrels are better-liked because they
have bushy tails. Just as most men
think Sinead O'Connor is ugly just
because she's bald. Throw a toupe on
a cobra and people will hug it. </PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
