<TD>This is the final week of the official Melancholy Contest.  Using the drawing to the left, we challenge you to create a piece of writing (of any length) 
to describe what you see, or tell a complete sequence of events, or a story relating in some way to what is drawn. 
(You will gain some credibility with the staff if at least one of our members can understand the connection between your writing and the picture, so do try to make some connections.) 
<STRONG>Bizzare and off color entries are encouraged.</STRONG> The best entries will be published in a future issue this quarter. 
Entries can be sent to the Predator c/o BJ Leopold @ 141B Perkins Rd., Rochester, NY 14623, or &lt;bjl4009@rit.edu&gt;

		"Sidhe invites you"

glamour-kilned again,
	dry glaze think we're crazed
	no vault too tight oven too bright
			we'll play soon 
steal out among
	resistant strains and birthing pains
	slumberer.  clutch your crosses
	not chicken bone-cock's comb
	Rubik's cube machine by Rube
		dance in your dross
			and soon we'll play
whail away hours
	while away laments...none of that
	me and Cobweb and Mab
	we're breakin'you out!
  	c'mon
		it's time to play
open wide rheumy eye
	get dazzled by comparison's metaphor
	glints and gossams spinning their mer
	walkrunfly around the mound
	and listen hard:
	music older than burning seraph fell
		play: you're newer than now
we've a place for you,
	among our host
	not rev'rent angel's wings, 
	not damned ghost
	claim eternal ancient youth,
		and play.
