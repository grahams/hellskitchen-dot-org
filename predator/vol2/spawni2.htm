	yourselves one loud, dirty, expensive, demanding, certified ball o' flesh, fit with all the trimmings.  Providing, of course, that you meet some basic competence and non-abuse requirements, since after all we want to raise children who have the potential to be useful and productive at least.  The current day-care and planned parenthood structures could easily be converted into competency testing centers, parental training programs and lottery departments.  The lottery proceeds would go towards child care and education facilities, and then the children we do produce will have a better environment to prosper in as well.
	<DD>Or we could go the natural, wholesome, evolutionary route.  We could let everyone breed freely, loose all the murderers into society, and let the corpses sit rotting on the sidewalks.  This would keep the densest populations in check (similar to the theory about hunters keeping the deer populations from overcrowding by hunting out enough of them that they don't diminish their food supply quite so rapidly) and if we can't make some use of the corpses, at least we'll be promoting the growth of carrion eaters and decomposers.  And as an extra benefit, the putrefying carcasses on the front lawns of modern America will  prompt many families (anyone whose olfactory nerves work) to move out to the countryside... which lessens the density in the population centers.  </DD><BR>
	<DD>Despite all the seemingly bad aspects of natural life, we'd rather see the freedom of a fetid, dank urban sprawl than the opressively waiting-room sterile, bleach-gene world predicted by Huxley and Orwell. </DD><BR></TD></TR>
