	Thinking

of the things I should have done
of the risks I didn't  take
of the experiences I haven't had
of the things I'd rather be doing now
of what I would like to do in the future
All  I do is think
I need to translate thought into action
Most of my ideas do not have the ability to harm
They will make me happier if I act
         If I allow myself the freedom
         To be who I am

This is the first official Melancholy Contest. With the above  drawing, we challenge you to create a piece of writing of any length to describe what you see, or tell a complete sequence  of events or story relating in some way to what is drawn.  (You will gain some credibility with the staff if at least one of our members can understand the connection between your writing and the picture, so do try to make some connections.)  Bizzare and off color entries are encouraged.   The best will have the chance to be published in a future issue.  All entries must be recieved by April Fool's Day.  Good luck.

We surveyed a random sample of Physiology & Anatomy Lab students with a comprehensive set of moral questions: Do you know what publication uses this symbol?  Fully 25% of those surveyed responded with a written answer! Over 16% gave a correct response!  Here are a few of the more interesting wrong answers. 
<P>
1) Cryin Snakes are Us!<BR>
2) A Save-the-Sperm publication?<BR>
3) Let's see...Ward's? Save the Whale Foundation<BR>
4) Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre, the Melancholy Part<BR>
5) Fulsperm<BR>

Ode to the chilliness about me<BR>
Ode to that funky thing called chilly<BR>
The way it engulfs me<BR>
and makes me feel less than I am.<BR>
(A simple ode to chilliness)(the way it is about.)<BR>
my face feeling just a bit prickly<BR>
A reminiscence of pins piercing the flesh?<BR>
The whiteness of the flakes that<BR>
fall around I are dismal reminders of a<BR>
place one could easily be driven to by means<BR>
of lesser sanities.<BR>
an almost pain<BR>

<DD>The power of stress amazes me.  It has so many different effects on various people.  It can contribute to overeating.  Or make you so nauseous or preoccupied you can't even think about eating.  It can shift your mind into overdrive helping you to produce your best work ever in less time than it took you to make a piece of utter crap when calm Or it can send your mind reeling, unable to make sense of the swirls of information and thoughts you know were in there just two minutes ago.   It can give you that boost of adrenaline needed to lift the back end of the car off your child when you normally couldn't even bench press your own weight.  Or it can make you  weak in the knees and even passed out cold on the floor.  I  find the variations utterly astounding.</DD><BR>
