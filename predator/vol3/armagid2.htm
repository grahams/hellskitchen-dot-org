<font size=+3>SubMission:</font><br>
<font size=+2>Me and Mine</font><br>
<dd>Yeah, so me and Solitude were alienating everyone around us (as usual), and we decided to get 
our lame asses out of the ditch, and go see some of out REAL friends; but then Solitude started 
whining about never having any time to herself, so I left her at home and went to get high with 
Blame.  We stayed out all night with Crackfiend and Insomniac, and had a rockin’ good time ‘til 
Blame told Crackfiend she wouldn’t twitch so much if she wasn’t, you know... addicted to crack.  
she tried to kick Blame’s ass, I got in the way, because I could see Animosity walking up the 
street, and at the end Crackfiend was so fucked up by the entire thing she had to go smoke 
some rock.  <br>
<dd>I turned to Guilt, who had just shown up, and she began to tell me that this fight was all 
my fault, that i was the cunt here, so i told her to fuck off. (me and Blame can NEVER get along, the 
bitch).  So I ran off to Mexico with Guru.  <br>
<dd>She wanted to ‘shroom, I asked her if she knew Psilocybin, yeah, so we went to his 
house, and got what we needed, yeah!  Freedom was in the city, somewhere, but I always seem 
to miss her by THAT MUCH, you know? Anyway, Guru got a little too philosophical on me, I told her 
that she was beginning to remind me of Zealot, and she told me to go find myself (as if I were 
lost) I was too high to piss about it.  Luckily, Cop-Out showed up, and I drove to Indiana with her, 
We walked into Woolworth’s (the last one left, may I add) and, holy mackerel, there Batman, 
Robin, and Pedophile.  They always hang out in those small, country places. After buying some 
‘cola’, and picking up Entertainment (who brought Tag-along, god knows why), we went to a 
punk-rock show.  Angry Band was playing, ya hoo, but then in walks Burn-Out and Beer-Gut, those 
motherfuckers started saying smack about us chicks, we get pissed, I spit, Cop-Out leaves, 
Entertainment made a snide joke, and Tag-Along just spilled the bong.  I walked off, saw this kid, 
Ex-Lover, grabbed his ass, and we decided to go see Lust. We invited Fornification (my dear, good 
nemesis), and the rest is for your imagination.<br>
