<TR><TD><i>Continued from p.1</i><BR>
<dd>The one physiological exception to this general rule is the orgasm.  During sex, your body produces gobs of enzymatic pleasure-givers in response to the sensory nerves on your skin instead of the risk-sensors in your mind.  There are however, parallel
s in the processes (e.g. if you are afraid of sex).  During orgasm, you wear a facial expression of pain, not pleasure, and many people also claim that activities like biting, scratching, and even whipping, are big turn-ons during sex, but are simply pain
ful outside the realm of sex.  Being whipped in the middle of the street by a stranger isn't <i>anybody's</i> idea of ecstasy.<sup>**</sup>  Pleasure and Pain are not so easily separated, and they are by no means polar opposites as often assumed by people
 who never experimented with the two (see "frustrated weasels with a marked ecstasy deficiency" in any encyclopedia, or email weasel@unfulfilled.org.asm for more details).  They are similar in nature, they use the same nervous system (at the same time- ho
w's that for confusion), and in certain types of situations, they are transmuted: pleasure into pain, and when you're lucky... pain into ecstasy.  <br>
<dl>
<sup>**</sup> On the other hand, if this IS your idea of ecstasy, let us know, and we’ll be happy to oblige.

Elation
	riding atop a cum-filled body
	groping
	hungrily searching for a fleshy
		pink nipple to satisfy
		my mouth's 
		yearning.		Knowing
						I should be the same girl
						who went to Sunday school
						diligently
						(and believed in someone else's
						misogynistic story).
Elation
	swimming in
		orgasmic
		contractions.		Knowing
						God says my pleasure 
						should come from my
						husband.
Instead, my lover pounds himself against
			my woman's belly and
			whispers	
			the untranslatable, inaudible
						psalm of adoration
						into my skin.
Elation
	found beneath my Sunday best
	first, at age twelve
	while exploring the newness
	of my rounding body.		Knowing 
						<i>He</i> would Damn me 
						for finding 
						my G-spot without a map
						(or a partner).
Elation
	Knowing
		and not giving
				a Damn.
