# Hell's Kitchen Public Web

## Steps to update the site

1. Introduce changes either by direct edits to files or approving pull requests from forks.
2. Notify grahams that a change was made so the site can then up updated from github

## Admin notes

1. Several of the directories use `welcome.html` in lieu of `index.html`.  Be sure to configure your webserver to consider both as index files
